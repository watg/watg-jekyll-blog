Here, we show you how to make tartan with knitting on our <a href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/tartan-lula-hoop-women/knit-your-own" target="_blank">Tartan Lula Hoop</a> scarf, but you can try it on anything you like!

<ul>
<li>To start, make sure that the 'purl' side of the fabric is facing you, and cut a length of yarn that is longer than the line that you are making.</li>
<li>Starting at the bottom of your knitting, fasten the yarn at the back, insert the needle through the fabric and pull the yarn through.</li>
<li>Next, insert the needle under the first horizontal bar and pull the yarn through.</li>
<li>Insert the needle under the second horizontal bar and pull through.</li>
<li>Repeat this step until you have completed the whole line.</li>
<li>To speed things up, you can insert the needle under several bars at a time.</li>
<li>Here, we have made lines which are separated by 3 stitches, but you can space them however you like!</li>
</ul>
