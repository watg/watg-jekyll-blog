<p dir="ltr">Learning a new skill can be like learning a whole new language. We like to keep it lean and clean here at WATG, so here's the low-down on all the terms you'll need to get hookin' like a pro. </p>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><span style="line-height: 1.55;">Crochet hook</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">The crochet hook is your tool on the path to greatness!</p>
<p>[stag_image style="no-filter" src="https://watg-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/2015/05/CrochetHook_0.jpg" alignment="center" url=""]</p>
<p>It has four zones:<br />
1. The handle, for you to hold it<br />
2. The  shaft, which determines the size of the stitches<br />
3. The point, which dives into your fabric<br />
4. The groove, which grabs the yarn to make new stitches</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Holding the hook AND YARN</h3>
<p>Hold the hook in your right hand, in whatever way feels most comfortable! The most common ways are to hold the crochet hook either like knife or a pen. Hold the yarn in your left hand, looped over your index finger so it's easy to scoop it up with the hook.</p>
<p>[stag_image style="no-filter" src="https://watg-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/2015/05/Chain_Stitch2.jpg" alignment="center" url=""]</p>
<p>[stag_image style="no-filter" src="https://watg-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/2015/05/Crochet_Tips3.jpg" alignment="center" url=""]</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Stitch</h3>
<p>Crochet is made up of individual stitches - each one looks like a little knot. Stitches look different depending on the pattern you're working in. When you're working in crochet, you normally insert the hook through the opening in the middle of the stitch, underneath both 'legs' of the sideways 'V' at the top of the stitch.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff00ff;">[stag_image style="no-filter" src="https://watg-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/2015/05/Crochet_Tips4.jpg" alignment="center" url=""]</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Chain stitch</h3>
<p>The most basic crochet technique - a chain made of stitches! It's the foundation of most crochet work, and can also be used as a technique on its own. When counting chain stitches, include the original slip knot, but don't count the stitch on your crochet hook.</p>
<p>[stag_image style="no-filter" src="https://watg-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/2015/05/Chain_Stitch3.jpg" alignment="center" url=""]</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Turning chain</h3>
<p>When working in crochet, you may need to do a 'turning chain' at the beginning of your row. This 'lifts' you up to the next level, so you're ready to crochet the next row.<br />
The turning chain is made up of chain stitches, and the number of stitches varies between different stitch patterns. (For example, single crochet uses a turning chain of 1 stitch, and double crochet uses 3 stitches.)</p>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">Single crochet</h3>
<p dir="ltr">This is a really simple technique which produces a firm fabric. Wanna give it a go? Our <a title="Carrie On Tote Crochet Kit" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/carrie-on-tote/crochet-your-own" target="_blank">Carrie On Tote</a> is hooked in single crochet.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #ff00ff;">[stag_image style="no-filter" src="https://watg-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/2015/05/single-Crochet2.jpg" alignment="center" url=""]</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">Single crochet though the back of the stitch</h3>
<p>This is a variation of single crochet that adds texture to your crochet, and can also be used to create folds in your fabric - perfect for three-dimensional pieces. It is created by inserting the crochet hook through the back of the stitch - i.e. only under the back 'leg' of the sideways 'V' at the top of the stitch. <span style="line-height: 1.55;">You'll use this lil' technique making our </span><a style="line-height: 1.55;" title="Twiggy Pots Crochet Kit" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/twiggy-pots/crochet-your-own" target="_blank">Twiggy Pots</a><span style="line-height: 1.55;">.</span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Double crochet</h3>
<p>This is a common technique where the stitches are much taller than in single crochet, so you end up with a more open fabric. Double down with our <a title="Partridge Placemats Crochet Kit" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/partridge-placemats/crochet-your-own" target="_blank">Partridge Placemats Crochet Kit</a>.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Slip stitch</h3>
<p>A slip stitch can be used for joining the beginning and end of rounds when you're working in tubular crochet. It can also be used as an edging around pieces, or to create a really firm fabric. Our <a title="All We Need Purse Crochet Kit" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/all-we-need-purse/crochet-your-own" target="_blank">All We Need Purse</a> uses this technique too.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Braided crochet</h3>
<p>This is a decorative crochet stitch that's created by inserting the hook between the stitches instead of into the centre of them. (Insert the hook between the two vertical bars that form a little 'V'.) Looking for a project? Our <a title="Jan's Vase Crochet Kit" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/jans-vase/crochet-your-own" target="_blank">Jan's Vase Crochet Kit</a> uses the braid stitch.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff00ff;">[stag_image style="no-filter" src="https://watg-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/2015/05/Braided_Crochet.jpg" alignment="center" url=""]</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Chain space</h3>
<p>A chain space is a 'loop' of chain stitches attached to your crochet piece. It can be worked across to create handles on bags or baskets, or simply for adding a decorative detail to your work. Once you've mastered the the chain space, why not try our <a title="Brady Basket Crochet Kit" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/brady-basket/crochet-your-own" target="_blank">Brady Basket Crochet Kit</a>?</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Tubular crochet</h3>
<p>You can work in the round to create a 'tube' of crochet that doesn't have to be sewn together. There are two main versions: in joined rounds, and as a continuous spiral.</p>
<p>This technique is used for starting off a circular piece. You begin by making a loop with your yarn, and then create your first round of stitches by working into this loop. When you're done, you pull on the yarn tail to close up the hole in the middle. Got it?
