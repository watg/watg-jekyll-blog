<p>Graphic designer, style blogger and <a title="White out" href="http://blog.woolandthegang.com/2015/03/white-out/" target="_blank">WATG supermodel</a> Alexis Foreman of <a title="Style Memo" href="http://brightonstylememos.blogspot.co.uk/" target="_blank">Style Memo</a> is our current girl crush.<br />
We sure do wanna steal her style - and very kindly, she agreed to give us a few pointers. Read on!</p>
<h3>We love your sense of style - who are your icons and what inspires you?</h3>
<div>I love Leandra Medine. I tend to drop by her blog <a title="Man Repeller" href="http://www.manrepeller.com/" target="_blank">Man Repeller</a> when I feel bored with my wardrobe. The way she dresses inspires me to be adventurous with my style. I also love <a title="Linda Rodin - The Coveteur" href="http://www.thecoveteur.com/linda-rodin/" target="_blank">Linda Rodin</a>. She's in her 60's and looks great for her age and also really stylish which helps me to look ahead and know that enjoying fashion and taking pride in your appearance doesn't have a sell by date. Jane Min of blog <a title="Stop It Right Now" href="http://www.stopitrightnow.com/" target="_blank">Stop It Right Now</a> is super cool. I have a good look through her feed now and then for some inspiration.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Plus I gain lots of outfit inspiration from <a title="Alexis Foreman - Pinterest" href="https://uk.pinterest.com/stylememos/" target="_blank">Pinterest</a>. I love collecting looks and growing my 'style' board...</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What's your all-time favourite beauty product?</h3>
<p>At the moment it's <a title="Hydro-Plumping Re-Texturising Serum Concentrate" href="http://www.kiehls.co.uk/skin-care/by-category/dermatologist-solutions/hydro-plumping-re-texturizing-serum-concentrate" target="_blank">Kiehl's Hydro-Plumping Re-Texturizing Serum Concentrate</a>. Since using it I have the skin of a nine year old.</p>
<h3>What essentials would you keep close in your Hold Tight Clutch?</h3>
<div>One of my MAC red lipsticks, bit of concealer and cream blush for a makeup top-up, iPhone, Aspinal of London x Etre Cecile card holder, keys and gum. If it's day time then I'd squeeze my Zanzan shades in too ; )</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What are your go-to fashion brands and why?</h3>
<div>Well I'm usually on a budget so I tend to shop on the high street mostly. My style is quite minimal so my favourite brands reflect that. I shop mostly at Whistles, COS and H&amp;M trend section. When I get Christmas or birthday money I dip into designer stuff. Acne Studios is obviously a favourite! I love loads of Scandi brands like WoodWood, Ganni, J.Lindberg, Carin Wester... I could go on!</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What's your soundtrack to Spring?</h3>
<div>I'm currently listening repeatedly to Tourist, Rosie Lowe, Jungle and FKA Twigs.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Describe your perfect weekend</h3>
<div>Out for dinner with my husband on Friday night to Brighton fish restaurant <a title="Riddle and Finns" href="http://www.riddleandfinns.co.uk/" target="_blank">Riddle &amp; Finns</a> for oysters and a bottle of wine. Saturday morning lie in followed by coffee from our local coffee shop @33 and pastries at home with our lovely boys. Then a walk through town (via my choice of shops) to the beach to take in the view. Then back to the North Laine for a few afternoon drinks and a bowl of chips at our local pub The Basket Makers. Then home for some Saturday night telly with the kids!</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Any other purls of wisdom you'd like to share?</h3>
<div>Never go to bed on an argument.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What's your superpower?</h3>
<div>Vaporising mess.</div>
