<p>[stag_intro]Please meet the lovely Shahnaz, a freelance Graphic Designer and knitting maniac! Shahnaz also has a love for crochet. When we knocked on the door, she was finishing off making her chairs some sweet socks![/stag_intro]</p>
<hr />
<p>We popped by her (very tidy) home in Wimbledon to meet her, for a cup of tea and chat about her love for making and why she joined our Gang.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">[stag_one_half]<strong>WHEN DID YOU FIRST PICK UP SOME KNITTING STIX?</strong></p>
<p>When I was very young my mum used to knit toys and clothes for my brothers and I. She’d go to knitting workshops and come back with some new creations I’d be fascinated with. So I pestered her to teach me when I was around 9 years old. I’ve never looked back since…</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>WHAT IS YOUR FAVOURITE STAGE OF MAKING A GARMENT?</strong></p>
<p>Can I say ALL OF IT? If I had to choose, it’d probably be the first few rows of making something for the first time and watching your creation take shape.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>WHAT'S THE WEIRDEST THING YOU'VE KNITTED?</strong></p>
<p>Hmm… chair socks?[/stag_one_half] [stag_one_half_last][stag_image style="no-filter" src="https://watg-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/2014/05/2V4A3161.jpg" alignment="center" url=""][/stag_one_half_last]</p>

<p><strong>FAVOURITE COLOUR?</strong> Turquoise.</p>
<p><strong>FAVOURITE YARN?</strong> At the moment I love WATG’s <strong><a href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/shop/items/crazy-sexy-wool/made-by-the-gang" target="_blank">Crazy Sexy Wool</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>FAVOURITE WATG PRODUCT?</strong> <a href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/shop/items/hold-tight-clutch-women/made-by-the-gang" target="_blank"><strong>Hold Tight Clutch Bag</strong></a> (it's my favourite WATG product to make too).</p>
<p><strong>FAVOURITE NEEDLE TO KNIT WITH?</strong> Probably around 8mm.</p>
<p><strong>FAVOURITE STITCH?</strong> I don’t use it so often but Cable Stitch – it’s so easy and yet looks so impressive.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>WHAT ARE YOUR PURLS OF WISDOM?</strong></p>
<p>Experiment and don’t be afraid to make mistakes, because it’s the mistakes we learn from the most.<br />

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>IF YOU COULD KNIT ANYTHING (REALMS OF REALITY DO NOT EXIST) WHAT WOULD IT BE?</strong></p>
<p>So much to choose from! I’d love to knit an entire, fully working town that people visit and come to have tea and cake and knit. I’d use all sorts of yarn – wool, jersey, plastic, metallic. It’d be kind of like Legoland, but a bit yarny!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>ABOUT BEING A GANG MAKER: WHY ARE YOU DOING IT? MONEY OR LOVE OR BOTH?</strong></p>
<p>Both – I knit/craft for pleasure so if I can get paid for it then that’s a bonus! (Also, I’ve always wanted to say I’m in a Gang)</p>
