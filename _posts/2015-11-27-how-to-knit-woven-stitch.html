<p>This week on <strong>Saturday Stitches</strong>, we show you how to knit woven stitch.</p>
<p>Woven stitch is one of our favourite stitches here at WATG HQ. Not only does it have a really striking, structural texture, but it's way easier to knit up than it looks.<br />
Here we have worked woven stitch over an uneven number stitches using our <a href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/jersey-be-good/yarn-and-wool" target="_blank">Jersey Be Good</a> yarn in True Blood Red, and we're slipping the first stitch of each row to give our knitting a nice, neat edge.<br />
So cast on and follow our step by step instructions, or click on the image below for our <a href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/videos/woven-stitch" target="_blank">video</a>. We'll have you working up woven wonders in no time!</p>

<p><strong>Row 1 (right side):</strong></p>
<p>1. Slip your first stitch.</p>
<p>2. Insert your right needle into the back of the second stitch on the left needle.</p>
<p>3. Wrap the yarn and pull the stitch through as for a regular knit stitch. Don't slip it off your left needle yet!</p>
<p>4. Insert the right needle into the back of the first stitch on the left needle.</p>
<p>5. Wrap the yarn and pull it through as for a regular knit stitch.</p>
<p>6. Slip both stitches off the left needle.</p>
<p>7. Repeat steps 2 to 6 for the rest of your row.</p>
<p><strong>Row 2 (wrong side):</strong></p>
<p>1. Slip your first stitch.</p>
<p>2. Purl the second stitch on the left needle. Don't slip it off the left needle yet!</p>
<p>3. Purl the first stitch on the left needle.</p>
<p>4. Slip both stitches off the left needle</p>
<p>5. Repeat steps 2 to 4 for the rest of your row.</p>
<p>Simply repeat these 2 rows to carry on working in woven stitch.</p>
