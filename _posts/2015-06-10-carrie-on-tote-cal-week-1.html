<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #ff00ff;">[stag_image style="no-filter" src="https://watg-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/2015/05/IMG_8630.jpg" alignment="center" url=""]</span> It’s time to kick off WATG’s first ever CAL! If you’ve never tried crochet before, fear not: we will teach you all the skills you need to crochet up your very own <a title="CARRIE ON TOTE" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/carrie-on-tote/crochet-your-own">Carrie On Tote</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">First of all, you need to familiarise yourself with the crochet hook. Watch ou<span style="color: #000000;">r <a title="video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIhncln5yww" target="_blank">video</a> f</span>or a little introduction to your new best buddy. There are two main ways of holding the crochet hook - pick the one you feel most comfortable with:</p>
<p dir="ltr">You can hold it like a knife…</p>
<p>[stag_image style="no-filter" src="https://watg-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/2015/05/Crochet_Tips3.jpg" alignment="center" url=""]</p>
<p dir="ltr">… or like a pencil.</p>
<p dir="ltr">[stag_image style="no-filter" src="https://watg-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/2015/05/Chain_Stitch2.jpg" alignment="center" url=""]</p>
<p dir="ltr">Also play around with how to hold the working yarn. Let it run over the index finger of your left hand. If you prefer, you can also loop it around one or two of your fingers to get some extra tension. There is no right or wrong here - do whatever works for you.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When you’re comfortable with your hook, it’s time to get started! The first thing you need to do is make a foundation chain. This is your first row of stitches, to start off your piece. Make your foundation chain by working in <a title="chain stitch" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yb2QHa9bck" target="_blank">chain stitch.</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">The next step is to start working in <a title="single crochet" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEYhKV2BpKY" target="_blank">single crochet</a>. You will now work into each of the stitches of your foundation chain - but before you start, you need to make one more chain stitch. This last stitch is your <a title="turning chain" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2STOkD6cBm4" target="_blank">turning chain</a>, which lifts you up to the next level, so you’re ready to work a new row.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Start your row by working into the second stitch from the hook, not counting the stitch on the hook itself! (see the picture below). Then work into each of the remaining stitches. When you get to the end of the row, turn the work around so the stitch on the hook is on the right-hand edge of the piece. You’ve now completed the first row - congratulations!</p>

<p dir="ltr">To work the next row, make a one-stitch turning chain as before, then start your row by working into the second stitch from the hook. Make sure you insert the hook under both of the little strands at the top of the stitch.</p>

<p dir="ltr">This week’s goal is to complete steps 1 - 4 of the pattern, so the base of the bag is complete and looks like this:</p>
