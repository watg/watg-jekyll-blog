It's the perfect pairing of our two recycled yarns, <a title="Mixtape yarn" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/yarn-mixtape" target="_blank">Mixtape</a> and <a title="Jersey Be Good" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/yarn-jersey-be-good" target="_blank">Jersey Be Good</a>.</p>
<h3>Let's get technical - yeah!</h3>
<h4>Fishnet stitch</h4>
<p>The <a title="Milo Beach Bag Knit Kit" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/milo-beach-bag-women/knit-your-own" target="_blank">Milo Beach Bag</a> is knitted in fishnet stitch. It's made up of two steps - a yarn over, which creates a new stitch, followed by a decrease, which evens out the yarn over. This means you'll have the same number of stitches on your needle as you started the row with. Simples. See the fishnet stitch in action in our video.[stag_video src="https://youtu.be/XMqdfakogTs"]</p>

<h4>WEAVING IN THE ENDS</h4>
<p>Our video shows how to weave in the ends in garter stitch knitting - it's the same idea for weaving in the ends in fishnet stitch too. Just follow the path of your stitches for a few centimetres (we recommend 10cm) and then trim.[stag_video src="https://youtu.be/GnxpK6k_QWk"]</p>
<h4>paracord strap</h4>
<p>The strap of your bag is made using a macrame technique, which is basically weaving and knotting. Here's how...[stag_video src="https://youtu.be/X2Thxst4bCw"]</p>

<h3>Top tips</h3>
<p><strong>(Don't) do the twist.</strong> <a title="Mixtape yarn" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/mixtape-yarn/yarn-and-wool" target="_blank">Mixtape</a> can occasionally get a little twisted. To minimise this, pull the yarn from the outside of the cone rather than from the centre.</p>
<p><strong>Sticky fingers.</strong> Having trouble getting those tassel ends on? Wrap some sellotape tightly around the end of your paracord before inserting it - much easier!</p>
<p><strong>Finish it like a pro.</strong> For a super-clean finish, you could use sewing thread in a matching colour to sew down the ends of your yarn after weaving in the ends - this way, those pesky yarn ends definitely won't poke out to the right side of the fabric.</p>

<h3>Pimp your knits</h3>
<p><strong>Mix it up.</strong> Can't decide what colour handle to make? Why not make more than one? You just need two additional tassel ends for each, plus around 50g of <a title="Jersey Be Good" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/jersey-be-good/yarn-and-wool" target="_blank">Jersey Be Good</a> yarn.</p>
<p><strong>Get in line.</strong> Why not add a lining? Just cut two pieces of fabric the same shape and size as your finished bag, seam the bottom and the sides, and tack it to the top of the bag.</p>
<p><strong>Go big.</strong> Once you've knitted up a <a title="Mixtape yarn" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/mixtape-yarn/yarn-and-wool" target="_blank">Mixtape</a> Milo, why not try one in <a title="Jersey Be Good" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/jersey-be-good/yarn-and-wool" target="_blank">Jersey Be Good</a>? It makes for a heavier-weight, more structured bag.</p>
