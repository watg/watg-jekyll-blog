<p>Last week was a busy one for us here celebrating all things Wool during <strong><a title="Campaign for Wool" href="http://www.campaignforwool.org/" target="_blank">Wool Week</a></strong>. Yup, we love the stuff! If you're in need of some inspiration here are three of our favourite bloggers sharing their passion about wool, knitting and their latest projects - now that there's a chill in the air. Check out their blogs too, we’re big fans.<strong style="line-height: 1.55;"></strong></p>

<em></em><strong style="line-height: 1.55;">Jacqui Fink of <a title="Little Dandelion" href="http://littledandelion.com" target="_blank">Little Dandelion</a> on her obsession with sheep</strong><br />
<strong style="line-height: 1.55;"></strong>“My love affair with wool started at a tender age. I grew up in a semi rural area and the word “sheep” or rather “eeps” was one of my very first words. I am told that I was slightly obsessive about sheep: whenever we drove past a paddock I would point furiously at the “eeps”, beside myself with excitement. I can’t explain the early connection I felt with this beautiful and humble animal but this I do know - we owe sheep much gratitude for all that they provide. The crimp of woollen fleece, the natural muted colours of wool, its sublime tactile and textured handle and the insane variety of applications makes wool top of the charts for me. This is an enduring love affair.”</p>

<strong>Meredith Crawford of <a title="One Sheepish Girl" href="http://onesheepishgirl.com/" target="_blank">One Sheepish Girl</a> on knitting vs Barbie Dolls</strong><br />
"Both of my grandmother's tried to teach me to knit and crochet when I was a little girl. I picked up a few of the basics but it didn't stick with me and eventually I gave up to pursue other creative interests, like playing with Barbie dolls. When I was in college I gave knitting a try again and fell completely in love. My dad's mom passed away several years ago, but I have no doubt that my grandma is proud of me and my passion for yarn crafts."</p>

<strong></strong>"Hope everyone had a lovely wool week! I'm spending a few days at Stinson Beach in Northern California and decided to bring my new <a title="Wool and the Gang - Superbowl Sweater Kit" href="https://www.woolandthegang.com/shop/items/superbowl-sweater-women/knit-your-own" target="_blank">Superbowl Sweater Kit</a> along. I haven't knitted anything in a while so it feels good to get back into it. I love spending a warm day in the sun and then a cool evening wrapped up in my favorite sweatshirt, knitting! Oddly, October is the hottest month for us here in the bay area but it still gets nice and cold in the evenings - it's a great combination. It was especially freezing tonight, as the sun went down and the fog rolled in. I'm excited about knitting this sweater because it's leading me into Autumn... Every time I pick it up, I'm reminded that the cold season is approaching us! One full of wooly knits!"</p>
