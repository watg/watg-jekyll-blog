<p>[stag_intro]It's that time of year again...yep not only is it the start of Autumn, it is the start of Wool Week here in the UK, hooray![stag_intro]</p>
<hr />
<p>If you didn't know already we will just recap; <a href="http://www.campaignforwool.org/" target="_blank"><strong>The Campaign for Wool</strong></a> is a global endeavour initiated by its patron, <b>His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales</b>, in order to raise awareness amongst consumers about the unique, natural, renewable and biodegradable benefits offered by the fibre.</p>
<p>Our kinda people! In aid of Wool Week we have teamed up with Campaign for Wool for you to win £200/$320/€255 on <strong><a href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/shop/knitwear/knitting/wool-and-cotton" target="_blank">WATG yarn</a></strong>, all you have to do it sign up <strong><a href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/campaign-for-wool-competition" target="_blank">HERE.</a></strong></p>
<p>We have also contributed to the cause by knitting up an oversized Wool Sweater for the Fashion Collection of Campaign for Wool. The sweater will be donated to an auction organised by the Rainforest Foundation (UK) for their 25th birthday in order to ensure that rainforests will be still standing for another 25 years! <a href="http://www.rainforestfoundationuk.org/" target="_blank">www.<wbr />rainforestfoundationuk.org</a></p>

<p>SO, to officially mark the start of Wool Week, The Campaign for Wool kicked off with the highly anticipated Wool Ride, that took place yesterday where 300 wool-loving cyclists took over Central London. It was a 13.4 mile cycle event scouring the streets of London to create awareness about the incredible versatility of wool in fashion, furnishings and everyday life. #woolforever #woolrocks</p>
<p>Some members of The Gang were up bright and early on a beautiful, crispy, sunny Sunday to take part and wave the Wool and The Gang flag, go Gang!</p>
