<h2>What you need</h2>
<p><a title="WATG Brady Basket Kit" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/brady-basket/crochet-your-own" target="_blank">WATG's Brady Basket Crochet Kit<br />
</a><a title="WATG's Jersey Be Good yarn" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/jersey-be-good/yarn-and-wool" target="_blank">Jersey Be Good</a> in four contrast colours (CCs). Katie used the following colours - CC1: blue, CC2: yellow, CC3: orange, CC4: pink</p>
<h2>Crochet glossary</h2>
<p><b></b><strong>CH </strong>- chain stitch<br />
<strong>SC</strong> -<strong> </strong>single crochet stitch<br />
<strong>DC</strong> - double crochet stitch<br />
<strong>TR</strong> - treble crochet stitch<br />
<strong>chain space</strong> - a little 'loop' of chain stitches<br />
<strong>3-stitch treble bobble</strong> - Start making a treble stitch in your contrast colour, but stop before the last step. (You now have 2 stitches on your hook). Make another two trebles into the same stitch, each time stopping just before the last step. You now have 4 stitches on your hook. Loop the main colour around your hook and pull through all 4 stitches.</p>
<h2>How to make your WATG x Katie Jones Brady Basket</h2>
<p>Work steps 1 to 12 as per the <a title="WATG's Brady Basket Kit" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/brady-basket/crochet-your-own" target="_blank">Wool and the Gang Brady Basket</a> pattern, then tweak the following steps...</p>
<p>Step 13: Work approx. 13.5cm/5.25" in single crochet. Next, you will start Katie's pattern hack!</p>
<p>Step 14: Add in CC1 by laying it on top of the previous row of stitches. Continue working with your main colour, trapping the new yarn inside the stitches. *Work 4 SC with the main colour, then switch to CC1 and work a <b>3-stitch treble bobble</b> into the next stitch.* Repeat the section inside the stars to the end of the round. Join your round with a slip stitch. Cut CC1.</p>
<p>Step 15: Work 2 rounds in single crochet, using your main colour. Join the last round with a slip stitch, then cut the main colour yarn.</p>
<p>Step 16: Add in CC2 and work 1 round in single crochet. Cut the yarn and secure the last stitch.</p>
<p>Step 17: Add in CC3 and make 3 CH (this counts as one DC stitch). Work another 2 DC into the same stitch. *Make 3 CH, skip 2 stitches in the row below, then work 3 DC stitches into the third stitch.* Repeat the section inside the stars to the end of the round. Join the round with a slip stitch into the third stitch of your 3-stitch chain.</p>
<p>Step 18: Still using CC3, *make 3 CH, make 3 DC into the next chain space.* Repeat the section inside the stars until you get to the last chain space. Make 2 DC into the last chain space, then join your round with a slip stitch into the third stitch of your 3-stitch chain. Cut CC3.</p>
<p>Step 19: Add in CC1 into the first chain space of your round. *Work 6 DC into the next chain space, then work 1 SC into the next chain space.* Repeat the section inside the stars to the end of the round. Cut CC1 and secure the last stitch.</p>
<p>Step 20: Add in your main colour by working a SC into the middle of the first 6-stitch fan. *Make 2 chain stitches, then make 1 TR into the middle of the next 6-stitch fan.* Repeat the section inside the stars to the end of the round and join with a slip stitch into the first stitch of the round. Cut the yarn and secure the last stitch.</p>
<p>Step 21: Add in CC2 and work 3 SC into each chain space throughout the round.</p>
<p>Step 22: With CC4, work step 14 from the original pattern.</p>
