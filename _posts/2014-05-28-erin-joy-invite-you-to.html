<p>[stag_intro]How exciting! Our Gang is now hosting Wool and the Gang Workshops all over the world, starting in Paris, Memphis, London, Berlin, Geneva &amp; New York! Our very first was with Erin in Toronto - here's a post about her experience (reblogged from <span style="color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif;"><a href="http://delovelydelightful.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">http://<wbr />delovelydelightful.wordpress.<wbr />com/</a>)</span>[/stag_intro]</p>

<blockquote><p>"This past weekend, Delovely HQ became Gangsta HQ as my pal J and I hosted the inaugural Knit Your Own Jewelry Workshop! I was SO EXCITED! The jewelry in question was the <a href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/shop/items/sansa-choker-women/knit-your-own">Sansa Choker and the Khaleesi Bracelet</a>.<br />
Yes, you heard me: making pretty things and <a href="http://www.hbocanada.com/gameofthrones/">Game of Thrones</a>. <strong>In ONE EVENT!</strong><br />
Seriously, interweb, I could hardly contain myself; my little geek soul was soaring, I swear."</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>"I invited a posse of knitters, artists, fashionistas and all-around creative types. They came in droves and we had a blast, knitting, sipping and chatting up a storm. Everyone left with a bracelet and a necklace she had made herself, a pair of gorgeous rosewood knitting needles and a pattern booklet so that she can make more  jewellery at home."</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>"People could order from the <a href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/shop/knitwear/women/accessories">WATG website</a>; they sell both ready-to-wear and knitting kits. We had samples of the yarn on-hand for people to see and touch, too. I am a sucker for the <a href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/shop/items/crazy-sexy-wool/made-by-the-gang">Crazy Sexy Wool</a> and the <a href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/shop/items/jersey-be-good/made-by-the-gang">Jersey Be Good</a>. The latter is made from off-cuts of t-shirts, the kind of thing the textile industry would normally just trash. It comes from Turkey, where the off-cuts are sent to various villages to be wound onto cones for WATG; the initiative makes use of textile waste and employs women in the villages. What’s not to love? We also had a <a href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/shop/items/lacey-sissi-women/made-by-the-gang">Lacy Sissy</a> scarf that my BFF made me for my b-day a couple of years ago and our gorgeous <a href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/shop/items/hold-tight-clutch-women/made-by-the-gang">Hold Tight Clutches</a>. The knitters came with a range of knitting ability and, once they got their rhythm going, there was no stopping them. The littlest Gangsta took to it like a duck to water!"</p></blockquote>
