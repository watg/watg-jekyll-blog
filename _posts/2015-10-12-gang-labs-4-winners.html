<p>[stag_intro]Our Gang Labs #4 winning designs are now available on site and we're loving seeing your finished pieces! We got up close and personal with the winning designers to find out a little more about the inspiration behind their work.[/stag_intro]</p>
<h1>Piazza Shoulder Bag</h1>
<h3>Designer</h3>
<p>Lindey from London, UK</p>
<p><img alt="Lindey" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_3679.jpg" width="180" height="180" /></p>
<h3>Inspiration</h3>
<p>I wanted to design a bag that you could piece together, I thought the whole process of making it this way would be fun- there’s something quite satisfying about seeing your small squares become a completed product! The inspiration behind the design was the granny square, a very traditional crochet pattern that I wanted to give a contemporary twist, so I kept it simple and concentrated on the texture of the bag. The name 'piazza' comes from the Italian word meaning 'city square' - I visit Florence often and it’s full of interesting and beautiful piazzas!</p>
<h3>Top Tip</h3>
<p>Look at what’s already available and go for something a bit different! Take time to plan it out and take plenty of notes along the way- but most of all just make it your own and enjoy!</p>

<h1>T'Lee Bag</h1>
<h3>Designer</h3>
<p>Melisa from Michigan, USA</p>
<p><img alt="Melisa" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_3676.jpg" width="180" height="180" /></p>
<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>I love mixing modern patterns with classic shapes in a fresh and interesting way. As soon as the competition was announced, I pored over all the crochet videos on Wool and the Gang's <a title="Wool and the Gang's Wool School" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/videos" target="_blank">Wool School</a>, hoping to find inspiration - and I did! I came up with the concept of utilising single crochet stitch to create a grid for 'needlepointing'.<br />
I also did two very important things. I approached the challenge as a Wool And The Gang designer <strong>and</strong> as a customer. I asked myself as a designer, what is missing from the collection? And as a customer, what designs do I enjoy making the most?  I looked at the specific needs of my client and at Wool and the Gang's top sellers to create a design that not only filled a void in the collection but was also fitted their unique style aesthetic.<br />
Naming my bag was easy. My Grandma T'Lee has always been a passionately, fearless entrepreneur. She's in her 80's (don't tell her I told you that!), but she's never slowed down her drive to learn more, do more, create more.  If it wasn't for her, I wouldn't be the ambitious, dream chaser that I am today!</p>
<h3>Top Tip</h3>
<p>Do make something that you love.<br />
Don't second guess your design as it progresses.<br />
Do the math to avoid mistakes before you get started.<br />
Don't be afraid of colour.<br />
Do pay attention to the details.<br />
Don't let life get in the way of your dreams - schedule yourself some time that you can devote yourself to the work and stick to it. That dream isn't going to make itself!</p>

<h1>Amsterdam Bag</h1>
<h3>Designer</h3>
<p>Lisa Novel from Geneva, Switzerland</p>
<p><img alt="Lisa" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_3677.jpg" width="180" height="180" /></p>
<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>My crochet bag is inspired by a wicker basket. I’m a real fan of baskets. I love how practical they are and their timeless aspect. I wanted to reproduce this look in the crochet to make it special. And I think the size is just perfect to carry all your essentials.<br />
The shape reminds me of the centre of Amsterdam. I lived there for a few months and I loved to cycle for hours in this amazing city - such good memories!</p>
<h3>Top Tip</h3>
<p>It's a great opportunity to create your own design. Don't think too much and start your project!</p>
