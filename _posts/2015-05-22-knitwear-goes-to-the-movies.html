<p>[stag_intro]And the award for the best knitwear goes to...[/stag_intro]</p>
<p>We're loving the outfits on the red carpet at Cannes, so we thought we'd pull together some of our favourite knitwear movie moments in celebration of the famous film festival. In no particular order, here are our celluloid highlights. Share your own nominees in the comments.</p>
<h1>THE SEXY ONE</h1>
<p>Look, but don't touch. But TOUCH! The pink dress worn by Nastassja Kinski in Wim Wenders' film, <a title="Paris, Texas - IMDB" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087884/" target="_blank">Paris, Texas</a> is one hot patootie. In fact, it was the inspiration behind Wool and the Gang's <a title="Quarterback Dress" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/quarterback-dress-women/made-by-the-gang" target="_blank">Quarterback Dress</a>.</p>
<p>An honorable mention in this category also goes to Nicholas Hoult's white mohair sweater in <a title="A Single Man - IMDB" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1315981/" target="_blank">A Single Man</a>. Someone's even spliced together <a title="Nicholas Hoult's Mohair Sweater showreel" href="https://youtu.be/JDbAH-Hh9Zs" target="_blank">a showreel of its screen appearances</a>. Enough said.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Nastassja Kinski's Sweater Dress - Paris, Texas" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/paristexas.jpg" width="720" height="492" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>THE POST-APOCALYPTIC ONE</h1>
<p>Katniss Everdeen's hunting cowl, as seen on screen in <a title="The Hunger Games: Catching Fire - IMDB" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1951264/" target="_blank">The Hunger Games: Catching Fire </a>took the crafternet by storm. If you don't believe us, go forth and Google - at the time of searching, Etsy alone had <a title="Katniss Cowl on Etsy" href="https://www.etsy.com/uk/search?q=katniss%20cowl&amp;ref=auto1" target="_blank">around 450 search results</a> for patterns and ready-made Katniss cowls. Somethin' like a phenomenon.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Katniss Everdeen's Hunting Cowl - The Hunger Games" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/katniss-catching-fire-2-537x402.jpg" width="720" height="540" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>THE one for the dudes</h1>
<p>Sure, Joel and Ethan are heading up the jury for this year's Cannes Film Festival, but we're not biased. The Dude's cardigan has got to be one of the most recognisable pieces of movie knitwear out there. It's actually called <a title="The Westerley Cardigan" href=" https://www.pendleton-usa.com/custserv/custserv.jsp?pageName=biglebowskisweater&amp;parentName=Heritage" target="_blank">the Westerley cardigan</a> and is made by US heritage brand, Pendleton. The one worn in the film belonged to actor Jeff Bridges, who wore his own clothes for the role of the legendary slacker. Chances are that if you're a knitter aged 30-45, at least one of your male friends will have asked you to knit this for them. <a title="Can you knit me a...?" href="https://instagram.com/p/x3_NIcFESq/" target="_blank">And you probably said NO</a>.</p>
<p>An honorable mention should also go to ALL the knitwear in <a title="Inside Llewyn Davies - IMDB" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2042568/" target="_blank">Inside Llewyn Davis.</a> It gives <a title="Very Good Aran Sweater" href="http://knitwithattitude.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/insidellewyndavis.jpg" target="_blank">very good Aran sweater</a> plus <a title="Justin Timberlake in a v-neck sweater" href="http://cdn.hitfix.com/photos/4505697/OscarIsaacJustinTimberlakeKennedyInsideLlewynDavis.jpg" target="_blank">Justin Timberlake in a tight v-neck</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="The Dude's Cardigan - The Big Lebowski" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/The-Dude.jpg" width="720" height="481" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>THE CRIMINALLY CHIC ONE</h1>
<p>If we were gonna rob a bank this is what we'd wear. Faye Dunaway's Bonnie twinned her nipped-in waist sweater with a beret to classically chic effect. Wanna steal her style? How about knitting up a <a title="Wool and the Gang's Bonnie Beret" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/bonnie-beret/knit-your-own" target="_blank">WATG Bonnie Beret</a>?</p>
<p>The real life Bonnie Parker was plenty stylish too - just check out the black and white image below. There's even speculation that Bonnie <a title="Bonnie Parker's Seemingly Unique Fashion" href="http://texashideout.tripod.com/dress.html" target="_blank">may have knitted this outfit herself </a>from a Minerva Paris pattern book of the time. Indeed, after one of the Barrow Gang was shot during a hold-up, Parker was said to have <a title="W. D. Jones Wikipedia entry" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._D._Jones" target="_blank">'prised open his wound with knitting needles and poured rubbing alcohol into it'</a>.</p>
<h1><a href="https://watg-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-22-at-20.31.39.png"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Faye Dunaway and the real -life Bonnie Parker" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Screen-Shot-2015-05-22-at-20.31.39.png" width="720" height="472" /></a></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>The Scary One</h1>
<p>Danny's Apollo 11 sweater in <a title="The Shining - IMDB" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081505/" target="_blank">The Shining</a> has its own conspiracy theory and some people believe that it's part of <a title="The Shining - conspiracy theories" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/the-filter/10253283/The-Shining-10-best-conspiracy-theories.html" target="_blank">an apology from the film's director, Stanley Kubrick</a>, for his part in faking the Moon Landings. Whoa, Nelly... That aside, it's a pretty rockin' sweater, and an homage featured in <a title="Coach FW 2014" href="http://www.cuttotheblog.com/coach-has-the-shine/" target="_blank">Coach's FW 2014 collection</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3799" alt="Danny 's Apollo Sweater - The Shining" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/The-Shining-Danny-Apollo-Room-237-610x358.jpg" width="720" height="422" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>THE AQUATIC ONE</h1>
<p>Wes Anderson's inspiration for <a title="The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0362270/" target="_blank">The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou</a> came from his childhood hero, Jacques-Yves Cousteau. Like the Steve Zissou's team, Cousteau's crew all wore red knit hats as part of their uniform. Start your own team with our WATG homage to this iconic headwear - the <a title="Wool and the Gang Zissou Hat" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/zissou-hat-men/made-by-the-gang" target="_blank">Zissou Hat</a>.</p>
<p>Additional hat trivia: the University of Texas knit cap worn by one of the pirates in the film is a nod to Wes Anderson's alma mater - he studied there alongside Anderson-regular Owen Wilson.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://watg-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-22-at-12.08.28.png"><img class="aligncenter" alt="The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Screen-Shot-2015-05-22-at-12.08.28.png" width="720" height="489" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1 style="text-align: left;">The Xmas One</h1>
<p>This category has A LOT on offer, but WATG HQ has a soft spot for <a title="Bridget Jones's Diary" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0243155/" target="_blank">Bridget Jones's Diary</a>, so for us it has to be Mark Darcy's reindeer roll-neck sweater. At first glance it's enough to turn our Bridge right off, though once she learns to love the man beneath the sweater, even its snowman sibling can't chill the fire in her heart. Plus his mum made him wear it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://watg-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/2015/05/static.squarespace.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3805" alt="Mark Darcy's Christmas Sweaters - Bridget Jones's Diary" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/static.squarespace.jpg" width="720" height="437" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1 style="text-align: left;">The Magical One</h1>
<p>Gah, this was a tough choice. The Weasley Sweater was a close contender, but after much squabbling we plumped for the Hogwart's First Year Scarf from <a title="Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone - IMDB" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0241527/" target="_blank">Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</a>. Yellow and maroon, Harry and pals' scarves are knitted in the colours of House Gryffindor. The Potter world is <a title="Harry Potter Wiki - Needlework" href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Needlework" target="_blank">full of knitters</a> - Mrs Weasley and her sweaters, Dobby and his socks, Hermione and her hats for house-elves - even Hagrid did a bit of knitting on a train.</p>
