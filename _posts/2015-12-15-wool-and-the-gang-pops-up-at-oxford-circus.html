<h2 style="text-align: center;">Wool and the Gang pop-up @ Oxford Circus tube station<br />
17th to 24th December</h2>
<p>Oh yes, the rumours are true! We are going to be popping up at Oxford Circus tube station for one week before Christmas, hopefully perfectly timed for all of you out there who just *might* have left your gift-shopping a liiiiittle late. We'll be stocking some of our classic styles as ready made pieces and as knit kits. Plus, every lunch time there's a half hour pompom keyring workshop and all week there's a chance to win a giant, pretty-much-human-sized <a title="Wool and the Gang - Alpacino" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/alpacino/crochet-your-own" target="_blank">Alpacino</a> soft toy too!</p>
<h3>Opening dates and times</h3>

<p>At the end of your workshop you'll walk out with one of these beauties - perfect as a gift, but also good enough to keep all for yourself!</p>

<h3>Win 'Big Al' (AKA our pretty-much-human-sized Alpacino soft toy)</h3>
<p>We know you all loved our <a title="Wool and the Gang - Alpacino" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/alpacino/crochet-your-own" target="_blank">Alpacino</a> soft toy, so we super-sized him - he's now approximately 1m 50 cm or 4 foot 9 inches!  We'll have Big Al with us in the shop and all you need to do to enter to stand a chance of winning him is pose for a selfie with him, pop it up on Instagram and tag <a title="Wool and the Gang Instagram" href="https://www.instagram.com/woolandthegang/" target="_blank">@woolandthegang</a> and hashtag <strong>#woolandthegang</strong> as well. We'll announce the winner on the 27th December and will ship to a London address only.</p>
