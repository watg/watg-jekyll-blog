<p><span style="color: #000000;">Hey Gang.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">So the news is out – we're doing something pretty radical. We're inviting our customers + supporters to actually become owners of WATG. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">What’s exciting is that anyone* can be an investor in Wool and the Gang and own a piece of the business. You can read more on <a title="We are crowdfunding! - Wool and the Gang" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/we-are-crowd-funding" target="_blank">our site</a> and check out our the full pitch on <a title="Wool and the Gang - Crowdcube" href="https://www.crowdcube.com/investment/wool-and-the-gang-19321" target="_blank">our Crowdcube page</a>.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We realise that not everyone is familiar with terms such as <strong>investing</strong>, <strong>funding</strong>, <strong>equity </strong>and<strong> </strong><strong>shares</strong> and that they can be confusing, so we've written this blog post with the aim of de-mystifying a few things for you...</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Let’s start at the beginning.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In order to grow, companies sometimes need to pay for things before they get money in from selling their products. For example, before a new product can appear on the <a title="Wool and the Gang - Homepage" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com" target="_blank">Wool and the Gang</a> website the design has to be created, which means paying designers, and the wool must be bought from the wool farmers in Peru.  </span></p>
<h2>So where does this money come from?</h2>
<p>Companies can ask investors to provide them with this funding. In return the investors get to own a share of the company – this is where the terms <strong>shares</strong> and <strong>shareholder</strong> come from. Owning a share is also known as owning <strong>equity</strong> in a company.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://watg-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-15-at-11.52.09.png"><img alt="money" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Screen-Shot-2015-09-15-at-11.52.09.png" width="138" height="127" /></a></p>
<h2>So the investor becomes a shareholder – then what?</h2>
<p>If the company grows it can become more valuable, and if this happens the value of the investor’s shares also increases.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://watg-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-15-at-11.51.27.png"><img class=" wp-image-4916 aligncenter" alt="value goes up" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Screen-Shot-2015-09-15-at-11.51.27.png" width="139" height="139" /></a></p>
<h2>That sounds like an easy way to make money…</h2>
<p>It is, but the value of the company can go down as well as up. That means that the value of an investor’s shares may be less than the price paid for them – if this happens the investor loses money. There is no guarantee that an investor will get their money back.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://watg-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-15-at-11.51.40.png"><img class=" wp-image-4917 aligncenter" alt="value goes down" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Screen-Shot-2015-09-15-at-11.51.40.png" width="131" height="139" /></a></p>
<h2>Great - but it all still sounds a bit <em>Wolf of Wall Street</em> to me. I’m not a banker and I don’t have mega bucks to invest.<span style="line-height: 1.55;"> </span></h2>
<p>That’s where Crowdcube comes in. It enables regular people to invest small amounts (as little as £10) in companies that they like. Companies make a pitch for investment which appears on the Crowdcube website and if you like the sound of it you can sig<span style="color: #000000;">n up to invest. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://watg-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-15-at-11.52.37.png"><img alt="coins" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Screen-Shot-2015-09-15-at-11.52.37.png" width="142" height="143" /></a></p>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;">Where can I learn more? </span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The <a title="Crowdcube" href="https://www.crowdcube.com/" target="_blank">Crowdcube website</a> explains all you need to know about <a title="Investing Your Money - Crowdcube" href="https://www.crowdcube.com/pg/investing-your-money-1513" target="_blank">being an investor</a> and has a very helpful FAQ section. There's also a <a title="Wool and the Gang Discussion Forum - Crowdcube" href="https://www.crowdcube.com/forum-topics/wool-and-the-gang-19321" target="_blank">discussion forum</a> on our Crowdcube page where you can ask us anything!</span></p>
<p>Hopefully we've made it all a little clearer for you, but if you still have questions you can ping an email over to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">info@woolandthegang.com</span>.</p>
