<div><strong><strong></strong></strong><b>Which are the </b><a href="http://camelliafibercompany.com/yarn/"><b>Camilla Fiber Company</b></a><b> best-sellers? </b><span style="line-height: 1.55;">My best selling yarn is always my black and white marl hand-spun alpaca. I can't keep it in stock! It's made from the fleece of some adorable alpacas who live right here in middle Tennessee. Their names are Feather, Casper, and Penelope. I'm their biggest fan.</span></div>

<div><b>Any personal favourites? </b><span style="line-height: 1.55;">I love all the Tennessee alpaca that I spin, it's so soft and luscious. But right now I'm also really into the </span><a style="line-height: 1.55;" href="http://camelliafibercompany.com/yarn/alpaca-merino-silk-blackberry"><b>mill-spun merino/alpaca/silk</b></a><span style="line-height: 1.55;"> DK weight I've started carrying. It's the absolute softest yarn I've ever worked with. It's like feather down.</span></div>

<p><b>Knitter vs Crocheter vs Sewer? </b><span style="line-height: 1.55;">Are they different types of people? Well, I know some folks that equally love and do all three. I am not one of those folks. I do enjoy sewing a bit here and there, but crochet escapes me. I finished a whole crochet ripple blanket a while back and vowed that I would never pick up a crochet hook again. It's just so difficult to me for some reason. But I love the finished product…I'm truly in awe of the beautiful, sculptural things I see crocheters put out. Knitting is my thing, though. My brain just works in two-needle stitches.</span></p>
<p><b>When did you first pick up some knitting stix? And who taught you? </b>I learned several years ago from a friend I went to art school with. She taught me over Skype! I was in my living room in Nashville, Tennessee, and she was in hers in Portland, Oregon. Skype knitting lessons are awesome. It was very fun.</p>

<p><b>What is your favourite knitting technique and yarn? </b>I honestly love everything. I can zone out to long rows of stockinette, or get really into lace knitting. I even like to purl. I LOVE blocking.</p>
<p><b style="line-height: 1.55;">We loved your Wool and The Gang yarn dyeing - any secrets for successful yarn-dyeing? </b>I don't know much about acid dyes, but with natural dyes it's hard to go wrong! It is important to use a mordant for most natural dyes or the color won't hold fast. I recommend Aluminum Sulfate…it's easy, non-toxic, and fast. There are lots of directions online for how to mordant fibers with alum. And then, you can really just experiment! I love solar-dyeing because it's energy efficient and easy on your yarn. I have big pots in my backyard with glass lids, and the yarn just hangs out in them with the dye for days. It's an especially good method during our long, hot, southern summers.</p>
<p><b>A maker’s breakfast should include: </b>Caffeine and carbs! Hot, dark coffee and toast with jam is my breakfast of choice.</p>
<p><b>Favourite places to knit? </b>My favourite place to knit is always on a sofa with a dear friend, a glass of wine, and lots to talk about.</p>
<p><b>What are your purls of wisdom? </b><span style="line-height: 1.55;">As we say in the south...Never judge somebody until you've walked a mile in their shoes. That way, you're already a mile away. And you have their shoes…. :)</span></p>

<div>
<p><b>If you could knit anything (realms of reality do not exist) what would it be? </b>A time machine. Yep.</p>
<p><b>Any current projects? And seasonal favourite colour combos/materials? </b>I'm knitting the <a href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/shop/items/uma-top-women/knit-your-own"><b>Wool and the Gang Uma top</b></a> in Ivory White! I love it so far, it's incredibly soft and I love summer whites!</p>
<p><b>Why did the Llama cross the road? </b>Llama think of something, and I'll get back to you…</p>
