<p>[stag_intro]On April 24 last year, 1133 people were killed when the Rana Plaza factory complex collapsed in Dhaka, Bangladesh, with many more injured. Today, people continue to suffer as a direct result of our fashion supply chain.[/stag_intro]</p>
<hr />
<p>On April 24 last year, 1133 people were killed when the Rana Plaza factory complex collapsed in Dhaka, <span style="line-height: 1.55;">This year on April 24, the fashion industry and its consumers from over 50 countries around the world – from designers and icons, to high street shops to factory workers and general customers will come together to raise awareness by asking the question “Who Made Your Clothes?”</span></p>
<p>On the run up to the first anniversary of the Rana Plaza disaster, we’re championing Fashion Revolution Day by remembering its victims and raising awareness of the fashion industry’s biggest challenge - transparency throughout fashion’s supply chain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[stag_image style="no-filter" src="https://watg-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/2014/05/Fashion_Revolution_V1.jpg" alignment="center" url=""]</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">Here’s how you can do to make a difference!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>- We’re asking our community what they’re wearing, to turn an item inside out, take a photo and post to either Facebook, Instagram or Pinterest with the hashtags:  #FASHIONREVOLUTIONDAY #WHOMADEYOURCLOTHES #INSIDEOUT and #WOOLANDTHEGANG</p>
<p>The images will be celebrated on a dedicated <a href="http://woolandthegang.com/" target="_blank">woolandthegang.com</a> page as Gangstas from all around the world do their bit to raise awareness.</p>
<p>"By supporting the people behind our clothing manufacture, we aim to increase awareness so that one day the fashion industry might change its approach to the supply chain. A true change starts with radical thinking, and we hope our Gang will support this cause that we’re so passionate about", said Aurelie Popper (WATG, co-foudner and creative director).</p>
<p>We couldn’t be more proud to say that our fashion is #madeunique - hand knitted by our global Gang of knitters. Whether produced in Peru or in London, we ensure that our knitters are able to work on their own terms from their homes. Pioneering the makers’ revolution, we want to show how important transparency is and how it could change a global industry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
