<div>Meet Iowa-based knitwear designer, <strong>Jen Geigley</strong>. One of Wool and the Gang's very first party hosts, she's just self-published a book, <strong>Weekend: Simple, Modern Knits</strong>.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Some of you may know Jen by her blog, <a title="Hey Jen Renee - Blog" href="http://www.jengeigley.com/heyjenrenee/" target="_blank">HeyJenRenee</a>, where she talks about her life and loves (which include knitting (obv), skateboarding and alt, metal and punk rock music!) or by her blockbuster design, the <a title="GAP-tastic Cowl by Jen Geigley - Ravelry" href="http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/gap-tastic-cowl" target="_blank">Gap-tastic Cowl</a> - currently at over 16,000 projects on Ravelry! She's a graphic designer-turned-knitwear designer who lives and knits in Des Moines, IO, with her husband and two children. We absolutely love her new book, <a title="Weekend by Jen Geigley" href="http://www.jengeigley.com/weekend/" target="_blank">Weekend</a> - not in the least because some of her designs use our <a title="Crazy Sexy Wool - Wool and the Gang" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/crazy-sexy-wool/yarn-and-wool" target="_blank">Crazy Sexy Wool</a> - and we think you will too.</div>

<h2>Tell us a little about your book, Jen...</h2>
<p><a title="Weekend by Jen Geigley" href="http://www.jengeigley.com/weekend/" target="_blank">Weekend: Simple, Modern Knits</a> is a collection of knits that you can wear on the weekend and make in a weekend. Knitted using bulky and super bulky yarn, this collection of sweaters and accessories exudes comfort and ease. My mission is to create casual, contemporary, wearable hand-knits that can serve as foundation pieces in anyone’s wardrobe. I’m a minimalist at heart and I truly believe less is more, and simple is good. To me, simple equals wearable. Simple equals doable. And there’s no greater satisfaction than finishing a hand-knit piece, trying it on and falling in love with it. My goal as a knitter is to make go-to pieces that feel just right, like my favorite soft gray pullover from college. If you spend precious time knitting a garment, you want to love it and wear it a lot. It’s as simple as that. That, to me, is the definition of hand-knit success. And that’s what I hope to share with knitters.</p>
<h2>When did you first pick up your knit stix? Who taught you to knit?</h2>
<p>The knitting bug bit in 2006 when I was pregnant with my daughter. I tried to teach myself to knit but it didn’t quite stick. In 2008, I discovered that two of my friends were knitters and they taught me how to knit, took me to my first yarn store and introduced me to <a title="Ravelry" href="http://www.ravelry.com/" target="_blank">Ravelry</a>, a social network for knitters and crocheters. After that, I devoured every knitting book, blog and video that I could find. I was obsessed.</p>
<h2>What's your proudest maker moment?</h2>
<p>Self-publishing <a title="Weekend by Jen Geigley" href="http://www.jengeigley.com/weekend/" target="_blank">Weekend</a>! This book took two years to write. I wrote and re-wrote the patterns (again and again), knitted the samples and then did the design/layout, all by myself. It felt like my secret project for a very long time. Going through the whole process from start to finish was challenging but extremely rewarding.</p>
<h2>Who or what is your knitspiration?</h2>
<p>I am inspired by architecture, music and fashion designers like <a title="Alexander Wang" href="http://www.alexanderwang.com/" target="_blank">Alexander Wang</a>. I'm not afraid of simplicity and I love the beauty of miles of plain stocking stitch. I'm also inspired by the cold midwest winter weather; I often think about what kind of accessory would get me through a blizzard or polar vortex. ;)</p>
<h2>What advice would you give to any aspiring knitwear designers?</h2>
<p>Jump right in. Draw lots of sketches, jot down ideas, cross things out, try again ... and then make it happen. The only thing holding you back is you.</p>
<h2>What's on your needles right now?</h2>
<p>I am knitting <a title="Undone by Jen Geigley - Ravelry" href="http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/undone" target="_blank">Undone</a> from my book and also working on a new cowl design.</p>
<h2>Who would you invite to your dream knit party?</h2>
<p><a title="Bjork" href="http://bjork.com/" target="_blank">Bjork</a>! OMG. Knitting with her would be absolutely magical.</p>
<h2>What's your purl of wisdom?</h2>
<p>No matter how busy life gets, make sure you make a little time to knit on the weekend.</p>
