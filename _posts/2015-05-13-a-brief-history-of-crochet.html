<div>[stag_intro]Crochet is shiny brand new to Wool and the Gang but it's been around for some time. Here's a mini-history and some fun facts to get you up to speed...[/stag_intro]</div>
<div></div>
<p>Ranking at #3 in <a title="Google's top how-to searches of 2014" href="https://www.google.com/trends/topcharts" target="_blank">Google's most popular how-to search of 2014</a>, crochet's beginnings were pretty humble. The first evidence of crochet in history was in early nineteenth century Europe, where it was referred to as 'shepherd's knitting'.</p>
<h2>Fit for a queen</h2>
<p>Having been invented as a method for producing a cheap substitute for traditional lace, crochet struggled to shake off its reputation as an inferior craft. However, that changed when<span style="line-height: 1.55;"> Queen Victoria gave it the royal seal of approval by buying crocheted lace made by Irish women who were struggling to make a living after the potato famine - Queen Vic herself even learned to crochet, making </span><a style="line-height: 1.55;" title="Canadian War Museum" href="http://www.warmuseum.ca/cwm/exhibitions/boer/queensscarf_e.shtml" target="_blank">eight crocheted scarves for veterans of the South African War</a><span style="line-height: 1.55;"> - and by the end of her reign, much of England was hooked.</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The word crochet comes from the French word 'croche' meaning hook.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">1920s and 30s</h2>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.55;">The twenties and thirties saw crochet make the move from a decorative embellishment to a method for producing entire garments. This classic cloche hat and stunning evening gown both echo popular designs of the era.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://watg-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-14-at-11.37.00.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3647" title="1920's Cloche Hat and 1930s Evening Gown" alt="1920's Cloche Hat and 1930s Evening Gown" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Screen-Shot-2015-05-14-at-11.37.00.png" width="1001" height="633" /></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The longest crochet chain measures 130 km (80.78 miles) and was created by Anne Vanier-Drüssel of France.</strong><strong> </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>1940s and wartime</h2>
<p>Crochet became part of the wartime effort in both Britain and the US - women on the home front could contribute to the war effort by hooking up items for the troops. In the spirit of austerity, crochet was also a great way of jazzing up existing outfits, in keeping with the 'make do and mend' attitude of the time.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The fastest crocheter is Lisa Gentry of the USA, who crocheted a total of 5,113 stitches in 30 minutes. </strong><strong> </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">1950s</h2>
<p>After the war, things were back on track - crochet evolved with the fashions of the day as you can see from these classic fifties shapes -including the ever-so chic wedding dress on the left.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="line-height: 1.55;"><a href="https://watg-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-14-at-14.17.08.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3708" title="1950s Crochet Dresses" alt="1950s Crochet Dresses" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Screen-Shot-2015-05-14-at-14.17.08.png" width="1231" height="575" /></a> </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong style="line-height: 1.55;"><strong>Unlike most mass-produced modern knitwear, which is produced on machines, crochet remains a hand-craft. </strong></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
</blockquote>
<h2>1960s and 70s</h2>
<p>The sixties was the decade where the crochet boom really began. Alongside the swinging fashions of the age, there was a huge trend for crocheted homeware.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://watg-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-15-at-11.25.27.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3716" title="Sixties Crochet" alt="Sixties Crochet" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Screen-Shot-2015-05-15-at-11.25.27.png" width="1231" height="470" /></a></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.55;">The 'granny square' also came into vogue. A simple design, this could be used to make a huge variety of clothes and accessories. There really was something for everyone - even Clint Eastwood got in on the trend.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://watg-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-15-at-11.22.34.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3717" title="Granny Squares" alt="Granny Squares" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Screen-Shot-2015-05-15-at-11.22.34.png" width="1231" height="549" /></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The largest crochet blanket in the world was made as part of Mandela Day celebrations in 2015 - it was a whopping 3,133 square metres.</strong><strong> </strong></p>

<h2>crochet today</h2>
