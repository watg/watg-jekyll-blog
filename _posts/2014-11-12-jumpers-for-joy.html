<p style="text-align: center;">We've teamed up with <a title="Save The Children" href="http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/" target="_blank">Save The Children</a> and the top British fashion designers to raise money and start a woolly revolution.</p>
<p>[/stag_intro]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our friends at <strong>Save The Children</strong> raise millions of pounds all year round to help poor and underprivileged children worldwide. This December you can help raise some cash in a fun festive way by taking part in the <strong>Save The Children annual Christmas Jumper Day</strong>, which takes place on Friday December 12<sup>th</sup>. Whether your jumper is hand-made, bought or borrowed, dust it off and <strong>do your bit with knits!</strong> Save The Children ask that everyone sporting a <strong>Christmas Jumper</strong> donates just £2 to help raise money for vulnerable children. <a title="Christmas jumper day" href="http://jumpers.savethechildren.org.uk/" target="_blank">Sign up here</a> or donate via text message by sending JUMPER to 70050. Plus the UK Government is doubling every pound you donate!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here at <strong>Wool and the Gang</strong> we thought we could do more than just wear our favourite festive sweater to work, so for the second year in a row we have picked up our needles to raise some money for <strong>Save The Children</strong>. This year our Gangstas have hand knitted 31 bespoke jumpers using our <a title="Crazy Sexy Wool " href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/shop/items/crazy-sexy-wool/made-by-the-gang/V811620644" target="_blank">Crazy Sexy Wool in Ivory White</a>. Each of our jumpers have been uniquely customised by 31 of British Fashion’s biggest and brightest stars including Lulu Guinness, Philip Treacy, Giles Deacon, David Koma, Jonathan Saunders, Mary Katrantzou, Pringle of Scotland and Sibling to name a few as well as students and alumni from London College of Fashion, and our very own Wool and the Gang designers. We wonder if you can guess which exclusive design is ours?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wanna get your knitted mitts on one of these covetable Christmas jumpers? Buy one! On December 3<sup>rd </sup><a title="Atterley Road" href="http://www.atterleyroad.com/the-road/do-your-bit-with-a-knit/" target="_blank">AtterleyRoad</a> will be hosting the Secret Christmas Jumper Sale. The big secret is that the designer of your new Wool and the Gang jumper won't be revealed until your new sweater is in your hands! Super soft and guilt free, each jumper costs £99 and every penny of your money will go towards Save the Children. A true Christmas treat.</p>
