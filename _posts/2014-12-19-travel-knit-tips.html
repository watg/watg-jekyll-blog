<section>[stag_intro]There is only one thing left to do after the chaos of Christmas. Grab your bags and run for the sun or the slopes! If you're like us and are planning an adventure for 2015 then you'll also be wondering how you can take your new knit projects on the road. </section>

<p>It's that time of year again: many of us will be travelling from near and far to spend time with our loved ones, or taking a selfish break for that much needed winter trip. But how do we as knitters make the best use of those countless hours spent in transit? Well, the trick is to always have some knitting handy! We asked Alexandra Brinck, our head textile designer, for some pointers on what to consider when knitting on the go:</p>
<p><b>On a plane</b></p>
<p>The first question people tend to ask is: 'Am I allowed to bring knitting needles in my hand luggage?' Unfortunately, there isn't a simple answer: different airlines have different guidelines, and airport security always gets to make the final call. The best thing to do is check the guidelines for the airline you're travelling with - you can usually find this information online - but be prepared for the possibility that you may not get your knitting past airport security. (Some travel knitters keep a self-addressed, stamped envelope with them just in case - that way, if they have to abandon their needles, they can just send them home via post.)</p>
<p><b>In a car</b></p>
<p>If at all possible, always get someone else to do the driving! Car travel can be prime knitting time - so volunteer to be in charge of snacks, music or entertainment... but make sure you get to be in the passenger seat instead of behind the wheel. It's also a good idea to give the pattern a good read before hand, incase you get travel sickness so you can just sit back, relax - and knit.</p>
<p><b>What makes a good travel project?</b></p>
<p>To be a be a good travelling knitter, consideration is key. As much as you might love working on that fluffy, oversized jumper, your fellow travellers may not appreciate being constantly elbowed, or having balls of yarn all over them. Be a considerate knitter, and work on something smaller instead. Knitting with double-pointed needles is ideal, as it requires less elbow room -and smaller projects take up less space in your bag as well. We recommend our <a title="Fight the power" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/fight-the-power-mittens-women/knit-your-own" target="_blank">Fight The Power </a>and <a title="Underground Mittens" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/underground-mittens-women/knit-your-own" target="_blank">Underground</a> mittens, or if you fancy something different why not knit up our <a title="Big Foot Socks" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/big-foot-socks-women/knit-your-own" target="_blank">Big Foot Socks</a> - perfect travel projects!</p>
