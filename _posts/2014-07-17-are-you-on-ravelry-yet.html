<p>For all us knitterly and crafty types, <a href="http://www.ravelry.com" target="_blank"><b>Ravelry.com</b> </a>really is the best thing since sliced bread! Not only can you find information about patterns and yarns from countless designers, Ravelry also has friendly forums where you can get pretty much any question answered - or perhaps answer somebody else's!</p>
<hr />
<div></div>
<div>Best of all - you can upload pictures and details about your own knitting projects, which helps you keep track of what you're working on, and also allows you to share your knitting with other people. (And of course you can have a look at what others are working on, too!)</div>
<div></div>
<div>Joining is completely free - and once you're a member, you can join the WATG Ravelry <a href="http://www.ravelry.com/groups/wool-and-the-gang---hang-with-the-gang" target="_blank"><b>group</b></a>, and check out our discussion <a href="http://www.ravelry.com/groups/wool-and-the-gang---hang-with-the-gang" target="_blank"><b>forum</b></a>. You can also have a look at our projects, for little sneak peaks of what we're working on.</div>
<div></div>
<div>So - what are you waiting for? Head straight over to <a href="http://www.ravelry.com" target="_blank"><b>Ravelry.com</b> </a>and join the fun!</div>
