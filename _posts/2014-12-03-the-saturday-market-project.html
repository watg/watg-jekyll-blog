<p style="text-align: center;">The Saturday Market Project is a curated marketplace for exceptional supplies, tools and creative technology. We chat with Bethan, SMP's UK Managing Director, to discover what she loves most about making.</p>

<p>Based not only in Washington DC but also just across the hall from us <a title="The Saturday Night Project" href="https://saturdaymarketproject.co.uk/" target="_blank">The Saturday Market Project</a> works with artists and makers from all over the world. On their website you can find the most unique, beautiful and useful supplies. The SMP products range from cup carving kits to make-your-own stamp sets and delicate embroidery scissors. We sit down with the beautiful Bethan who gives us an insight into what they are all about.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Tell us how you got started?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">It seemed to us that it was harder than it should be to get hold of good quality making supplies, especially if you’re new to a particular area. We started SMP to try and make that search more enjoyable. We launched in the <a href="https://saturdaymarketproject.com/" target="_blank">US</a> and <a href="https://saturdaymarketproject.co.uk/" target="_blank">UK</a> in 2014.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>What inspires you the most?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">People. People who fly robots that tie knots, dye fabrics that measure air turbulence, make objects that fix problems or dedicate their lives to communicating the history of scent…there is an amazing thing happening right now in making and craft. It’s not only an increase in people getting their hands dirty, it’s an amazing mix-up of making, technology and sciences. It’s a really inspiring time.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have a favourite craft?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Nope, how could I? Each one is so rich and full of possibilities. I have an MA in Ceramics and Glass, but I also work with needlepoint tapestry, drawing, painting, even scrap wood put together with Sugru...that sense of breadth is really important at SMP.</p>
<p><strong>What is the first thing you ever made?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Possibly a tree house, a team effort with two older neighbours. I was still in miniature dungarees, so I’m not sure how valuable my slapdash hammering was to the project, but it’s a very special memory.</p>
<p><strong>Are you working on any projects at the moment?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">We’re all about our Holiday events. In the US we’ll be appearing at <a href="http://brooklynflea.com/markets/winter-flea-holiday-market/" target="_blank">Brooklyn Flea</a> and in London we’re popping up at <a href="https://saturdaymarketproject.co.uk/blog/266/krijtjes-little-crayons---a-workshop-at-heals" target="_blank">Heal’s</a>, <a href="https://saturdaymarketproject.co.uk/blog/267/smp-at-the-barbican-christmas-market" target="_blank">The Barbican Christmas Market</a> and The <a href="http://www.vam.ac.uk/whatson/event/3763/making-it-careers-in-art-and-design-5242/" target="_blank">V&amp;A’s Making It</a> event. We’ll also be in residence at The Old Shoreditch Station, part of <a href="http://www.jaguarshoes.com/" target="_blank">JaguarShoes Collective</a> for the whole of December with a pop-up shop and weekly activities including crayon making and cocktail gemology.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your favorite Saturday Market Project product?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">That’s a really tricky one! Everything on SMP is chosen by or created with us, but I have a soft spot for our <a href="https://saturdaymarketproject.co.uk/shop/362/barn-the-spoon-spatula-carving-kit-spatula-kit" target="_blank">Barn The Spoon Spatula Carving Kit</a>. It was the first in our range of <a href="https://saturdaymarketproject.co.uk/search?s=colab" target="_blank">SMPCoLab</a> products, where we collaborate with artists, designers and craftspeople to share their skills. Barn is remarkable and knowledgeable, we got so much from working with him.</p>
<p><strong>If you could only have one tool what would it be, and how would you use it?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">I’d have a Mora 106 Woodcarving knife. Barn made me understand that if you learn to carve wood you can have pretty much whatever you need in your hands in minutes. So I could make palette knives, knitting needles, a rudimentary mallet… Is that cheating?</p>
<p dir="ltr">[stag_image style="no-filter" src="https://watg-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/2014/12/carvingknife.jpg" alignment="none" url=""]</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Are you a knitter? If you could knit anything (absolutely anything) what would it be?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">I’ve a funny feeling I will be soon. I’d like to knit elaborate bed hangings to keep the London winter out. The design would be inspired by <a href="http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/t/the-boar-and-bear-hunt-tapestry2/" target="_blank">The Boar and Bear Hunt Tapestry in The Victoria and Albert Museum</a> and it would have pockets inside for books. Probably though I’ll start with a <a href="https://www.woolandthegang.com/shop/items/pride-rock-snood-women/knit-your-own" target="_blank">Pride Rock Snood</a> and see how I get on.</p>
<p><strong>If you could enjoy a tea with one maker who would it be and why?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Johann Frederick Böttger, the alchemist, because he was the first European to discover the formula for porcelain, or ‘white gold’. He did this in the 18th century whilst imprisoned in a castle in Dresden by Augustus the Strong.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Any purls of wisdom for the new year?</strong></p>
