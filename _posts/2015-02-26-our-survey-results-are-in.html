<p><a href="http://magazine.foxnews.com/celebrity/kate-middleton-and-other-celebs-known-knit" target="_blank">Kate Moss does it. Kate Middleton does it. Even Ryan Gosling does it</a>. It’s knitting, and in case you haven't noticed, it’s on the rise. Knitting is making the big come back we have all been waiting for, with over 7.3 million knitters in the UK and a further 53 million in the USA. Here at Wool and the Gang we wanted to do some research of our own, and what better participants to focus on than you? 4,000 knitters filled in our survey telling us all about your knitting habits and secrets.</p>
<p>Our favourite part of the day is getting home, putting up our feet and picking up our needles. It seems we are not alone - with 90% of US knitters and 86% of UK and European knitters ‘grabbing their knitting needles’ after a long stressful day, it seems that knitting is one of your favourite ways to relax. The benefits of knitting just get better and better with a huge 90% of knitters agreeing that knitting decreases anxiety levels, while 70% feel a sense of happiness after tackling a difficult project or knitting technique.</p>
<p>WATG's Aurelie describes knitting as the new yoga: “Growing demand is there for a hobby that has the same meditative qualities and the ability to bring about a feeling of calm, peace, accomplishment and creativity. It’s not surprising that it has such a positive impact on people’s lives.” Alongside meditative hobbies such as yoga and meditation, knitting and crochet were in the <a href="http://www.google.com/trends/topcharts" target="_blank">top Google ‘how to’ searches</a> of last year with a 70% increase from 2013. Power to the maker!</p>
<p>We also discovered that as well as improving our memory, dexterity and wardrobes, knitting is actually a great anti-depressant. Unfortunately depression is on the rise but fear not - our survey shows that knitting has helped an incredible 40% of knitters to fight depression. That number rises significantly among US knitters (up to 48%), with 33% and 28% for UK and European knitters respectively. Add to that a further 20% of people stated that knitting has enabled them to recover from an illness. Not bad for a humble craft.</p>
<p>So the next time you feel guilty about spending that extra half an hour on your latest project, don’t. After all, it’s good for you.</p>
