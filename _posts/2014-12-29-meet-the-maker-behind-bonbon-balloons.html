<section>Floating around in East London is balloon company <a title="Bonbon Balloons" href="http://bonbonballoons.com/" target="_blank">Bonbon Balloons</a>. Their playfully large, candy coloured balloons are not your ordinary balloons. To celebrate the start of 2015 we gave Bonbon Balloons a woolly make-over and sat down with their creator, Rebecca Moyster. </section>

<p>Here at WATG we love any excuse to get crafty, so to welcome in 2015 <a title="bombom ballons" href="http://bonbonballoons.com/">Bonbon Balloons</a> sent over a few of their magical balloons for us to play with. Just in time for our New Year celebrations! Our creative team, armed with their stix and wool, gave their balloons a Wool and the Gang makeover. Filled with our favourite silver, glitter confetti we covered our balloon strings with our leftover Christmas <a title="pom-pom garland " href="http://blog.woolandthegang.com/2014/12/how-to-make-a-pom-pom-garland/">garland pom-poms</a>.</p>
<p><a title="bonbon ballons" href="http://bonbonballoons.com/" target="_blank">Bonbon Balloons</a> is a brand we love. It's not your typical balloon company, every balloon is <a title="Shop Bonbon Balloons" href="http://bonbonballoons.com/bonbon-shop/" target="_blank">made to request</a> and comes floating out their box, covered in confetti and with a decorative string. Each string is hand crafted with origami hearts, ruffles, bows and aeroplanes, and now <a title="Pom-pom Balloon" href="http://bonbonballoons.com/shop/pom-pom-bubble-bonbon/" target="_blank">pom-poms</a>. But before we give you a sneak peek of our balloons (and put on our disco boots) we caught up with Bonbon Balloon's queen, Rebecca Moyster, for a chat about super powers and world balloon domination.</p>

<p><b>What made you start Bonbon Balloons?</b></p>
<p>I just thought balloons always looked so old fashioned and egg shaped! I had always been in love with the Tim Walker images of the giant round balloons and thought how beautiful they looked. I then started thinking how the balloon string had always been ignored and started to create decorative strings. I thought this type of product could be bespoke to fit with any theme or brand and it kind of grew from that.</p>
<p><b>What inspires you?</b></p>
<p><b></b>My background is in fashion and interiors so I guess these areas inspire me a lot. I am constantly looking at colours and how they work together, and this always leads me on to my next idea.</p>
<p><b>What's the best thing about making balloons?</b></p>
<p>They always make people smile, no matter what age or gender, every time people see a balloon they smile.</p>
<p><b>What would be your dream balloon?</b></p>
<p>A giant balloon in black &amp; white stripes with a bright coral pink string.</p>
<p><b>What's next for Bonbon Balloons?</b></p>
<p>World balloon domination! Make the world smile!</p>
<p><b>What do you do when you're not making balloons?</b></p>
<p>Think about balloons and I spend lots of time with my beautiful baby boy Sam and my boyfriend Jack.</p>
<p><b>What's your superpower?</b></p>
<p>To be able to teleport anywhere at anytime. I could go to New York for my breakfast, Italy for lunch, then Lancashire and see my gran for a cuppa in the afternoon, and then have dinner with my best mate who lives in LA! The perfect day.</p>
<p><b>If you could make one person breath and talk with helium, who would that be?</b></p>
<p>Anna Wintour, she is always so serious!</p>
<p>Keep your eyes out for our big WATG x Bonbon Balloons reveal. If you just can't wait then here is a sneaky look at the making of our <a title="How to make pom-poms" href="http://blog.woolandthegang.com/2014/05/3-minute-pom-pom/" target="_blank">pom-pom</a> Bonbon Balloons.</p>
