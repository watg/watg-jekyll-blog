<p>Today we are working with our <a href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/sheepaca/yarn-and-wool/V412152071" target="_blank">Sheepaca yarn</a> with two strands held together. To begin, cast on an uneven number of stitches (we cast on 21 stitches on 5mm (US8) needles) and knit 2 rows.</p>
<p>ROW 1 (right side):</p>
<ul>
<li>*Knit 1 stitch.</li>
<li>Insert the right needle in to the loop directly below the next stitch on the left needle. Wrap the yarn and pull it through. Slip the stitch off the needle (it may feel as if you're about to drop it but don't worry, it's completely safe!).*</li>
<li>Repeat the section inside the stars until you have just 1 stitch left of your row, knit this stitch.</li>
</ul>
<p>ROW 2 (wrong side):</p>
<ul>
<li>*Knit 1 stitch.</li>
<li>With the right needle, pick up the strand of yarn that sits over the next stitch. Slip the next stitch knit-wise. Insert the left needle through the two slipped loops, from left to right. Wrap the yarn and pull it through. Slip the stitches off the right needle.*</li>
<li>Repeat the section inside the stars until you have just one stitch left of your row, knit this stitch.</li>
</ul>
<p>ROW 3 (right side):</p>
<ul>
<li>Knit into the stitch below the first stitch on the left needle.</li>
<li>*Knit 1 stitch.</li>
<li>Knit into the stitch below the next stitch on the left needle.*</li>
<li>Repeat the section inside the stars until you have reached the end of your row.</li>
</ul>
<p>ROW 4 (wrong side):</p>
<ul>
<li>With the right needle, pick up the strand of yarn that sits over the first stitch. Slip the first stitch knit-wise. Insert the left needle through the two slipped loops, from left to right. Wrap the yarn and pull it through. Slip the stitches off the right needle. This is known as knitting stitches together through the back loop.</li>
<li>*Knit 1 stitch.</li>
<li>Pick up the strand that sits over the next stitch, slip the stitch. Knit them together through the back loop.*</li>
<li>Repeat the section inside the stars until you have reached the end of your row.</li>
</ul>
<p>Simply keep repeating these 4 rows to form the pattern. Want to put your new hexagon stitch skills into practice?
