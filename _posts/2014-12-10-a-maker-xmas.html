<section>[stag_intro]We all like to get crafty at Christmas, making your own gifts is not only cheaper and more thoughtful but it can also be relaxing and rewarding. We catch up with some of our Gangstas to find out what they have been knitting this festive season. </section>

<p>Our team of 200 UK Gang Makers knit Wool and the Gang designs in their own time and sell their woolly creations on our site, earning money by doing what they love. In the lead up to Christmas our Gangstas have been busy knitting up woolly treats for their friends and family, as well making Wool and the Gang goodies, that may even end up in your stocking! We got in touch with Gang members Lara, Angharad, Nicola, Siân and Liz who shared their Christmas knit lists with us.</p>
<p>[stag_image style="no-filter" src="https://watg-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/2014/12/Gang_Lara_01.jpg" alignment="none" url=""]</p>
<p><strong>What’s your name and where are you from? </strong>I’m Lara and I’m from Cheshire. I recently moved to London for university.</p>
<p><strong>How long have you been a Gangsta and what have you made? </strong>I’ve only been a Gangsta for a few months, but in that time I’ve knitted up a couple of <a title="Lil Snood Dogg Mini Gang " href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/shop/items/mini-snood-mini/knit-your-own" target="_blank">Mini Lil Snood Dogg</a>s, customised some <a title="Say My Name Beanie" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/shop/items/say-my-name-beanie-women/knit-your-own" target="_blank">Say My Name Beanies</a> and I’m currently knitting up some<a title="Zion Lion Beanie" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/shop/items/tartan-zion-lion-women/made-by-the-gang" target="_blank"> Zion Lions</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the best thing about being a Gangsta? </strong>For me the best thing is being a part of a brand that I really love and gaining experience in the knitting industry, which I hope to work in after I graduate. Being able to do my favourite hobby and improve my skills for a bit of pocket money is also pretty cool!</p>
<p><strong>What’s your favourite WATG knit to date? </strong>Picking a favourite is so hard. I’ll go for the <a title="Tartan Lula Hoop" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/shop/items/tartan-lula-hoop-women/knit-your-own" target="_blank">Tartan Lula Loop</a> - it's easy and the <a title="Tartan Lula Hoop" href="http://blog.woolandthegang.com/2014/11/tartan-technique/" target="_blank">tartan technique</a> is really effective.</p>
<p><strong>What’s on your Xmas knit list? </strong>I’m going to knit some cabled socks for a couple of people, but I can’t say who for - it’s a surprise.</p>
<p><strong>If Santa could bring you any WATG knit kit what would it be? </strong>Well I’ll admit that most of my Christmas list consists of WATG knit kits! But if it can only be one then I would pick the <a title="River Kiss Sweater" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/shop/items/river-kiss-sweater-women/knit-your-own" target="_blank">River Kiss Sweater</a> in <a title="Sheepaca " href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/shop/items/sheepaca/V657828335" target="_blank">Boyish Burgundy</a> - I love the dramatic cables going up the arms and it looks super cosy.</p>

<p>[stag_image style="no-filter" src="https://watg-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/2014/12/Gang_Angharad_01.jpg" alignment="none" url=""]</p>
<p><strong>What's your name and where are you from? </strong>I’m Angharad and I live in Cardiff.</p>
<p><strong>How long have you been a Gangsta and what have you made? </strong>I’ve been a Gangsta since Summer 2013 - I jumped at the chance! Some of my projects include the <a title="Yummy Scarf" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/shop/items/yummy-scarf-women/knit-your-own" target="_blank">Yummy Scarf</a>, <a title="Gobi Beanie" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/shop/items/gobi-beanie-women/knit-your-own" target="_blank">Gobi Beanie</a>, <a title="Zigazag shopper" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/shop/items/zigazig-shopper-women/knit-your-own" target="_blank">Zigazig Shopper</a> and <a title="Zion Lion" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/shop/items/zion-lion-women/made-by-the-gang" target="_blank">Zion Lion</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What's the best thing about being a Gangsta? </strong>I absolutely love being part of a community of knitters who make lovely hand-knit pieces using beautiful yarns. I also like the challenge that knitting up a new project brings. It’s great to expand my knitting repertoire.</p>
<p><strong>What's your favourite WATG knit to date? </strong>I really enjoyed making the <a title="Yummy Scarf" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/shop/items/yummy-scarf-women/knit-your-own" target="_blank">Yummy Scarf</a>. Knitting with Crazy Sexy Wool is always lovely and using the huge <a title="Rosewood needles" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/shop/items/rosewood-needles/made-by-the-gang/V017634250?page=2" target="_blank">25mm needles</a> means that it's a super quick progress.</p>
<p><strong>What's on your Xmas knit list? </strong>Beanies are always a winner so I’ll definitely be making a few <a title="Zion Lion " href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/shop/items/zion-lion-women/made-by-the-gang" target="_blank">Zion Lion</a>s for my friends &amp; family. I also want to make the John Lewis knitted penguins and some knitted stocking fillers. I've got busy hands!</p>
<p><strong>If Santa could bring you any WATG knit kit what would it be? </strong>I hope Santa doesn’t know how big my yarn stash is! It’s so hard to pick one kit so I’m going for one big project and one little one: <a title="Even Flow Sweater" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/shop/items/even-flow-sweater-women/knit-your-own" target="_blank">Even Flow Sweater </a>&amp; <a title="Rockwell Mittens" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/shop/items/rockwell-mittens-women/knit-your-own" target="_blank">Rockwell Mittens</a>.</p>

<p>[stag_image style="no-filter" src="https://watg-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/2014/12/Gang_Nicola_01.jpg" alignment="none" url=""]</p>
<p><b>What's your name and where are you from? </b>Nicola Furey. I’m a Londoner but I’ve just moved to Bedford with my small family.</p>
<p><b>How long have you been a Gangsta and what have you made? </b>I joined the Gang last autumn. It has been exciting seeing the London business grow and take on exciting new projects and collaborations with top fashion designers and brands.  I have knitted A LOT of <a title="Zion Lion " href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/shop/items/zion-lion-women/made-by-the-gang" target="_blank">Zion Lion</a> style hats in various forms; plain, stripy, the Eek version for Giles and I loved the collaboration with MFP jewellery. I've also made the <a title="Lil Snood dogg" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/shop/items/lil-snood-dogg-women/made-by-the-gang" target="_blank">Lil Snood Dogg</a>, <a title="Lil Muffler" href="https://www.woolandthegang.com/shop/items/lil-muffler-women/knit-your-own" target="_blank">Lil Muffler</a>, <a href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/shop/items/sleeves-to-the-rhythm-women/knit-your-own" target="_blank">Sleeves to the Rhythm</a>, <a href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/shop/items/hold-tight-clutch-women/made-by-the-gang" target="_blank">Hold Tight Clutch</a> and <a href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/shop/items/zigazig-shopper-women/knit-your-own" target="_blank">Zigazig Shopper</a>.</p>
<p><b>What's the best thing about being a Gangsta? </b>The best thing is working with the beautiful yarn! I also enjoy the variety and flexibility of the work. The patterns are clear, fun and on-trend.</p>
<p><b>What's your favourite WATG knit to date? </b>My favourite changes each season! Right now I'm loving my <a title="Cast Away Scarf" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/shop/items/cast-away-scarf-women/knit-your-own" target="_blank">Cast Away Scarf</a>. The kit was my first ever purchase from WATG, before I became a Gangsta. I love the weight and drape of it, and I'm often complimented on it. Now we are into December, and its got noticeably colder, I need to trade it in and finally finish making my <a title="Lil Snood Dogg" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/shop/items/lil-snood-dogg-women/made-by-the-gang" target="_blank">Lil Snood Dogg</a>.</p>
<p><b>What's on your Xmas knit list? </b>My list is huge! Both my husband and I have three siblings each and all with a spouse, adding in my two gorgeous nephews and my son means that I start my Christmas knitting in June! I love knitting accessories as the projects are normally quick and you can add personal touches with the trims. I've made several pairs of wrist warmers for my sister-in-laws and a new hot water bottle cover for my Gran. I am yet to finish a stripy cardigan for my son and my husband has been asking for a <a title="Wellington " href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/shop/items/wellington-hat-men/knit-your-own" target="_blank">Wellington </a>Hat since last winter, maybe this year he will get lucky!</p>
<p><b>If Santa could bring you any WATG knit kit what would it be? </b>Can I be cheeky and mention two? Personally I would love the new <a title="Free Spirt Snood" href="https://www.woolandthegang.com/shop/items/free-spirit-snood-women/knit-your-own" target="_blank">Free Spirit Snood</a>. Also on my wish list would be a Mini Helsinki hat for my son.</p>

<p><b>What's your name and where are you from? </b>I’m Siân Landau and I live in North London.</p>
<p><b>How long have you been a Gangsta and what have you made? </b>I've been a Gangsta for five months and have made a number of hats including <a title="Zion Lion" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/shop/items/zion-lion-women-1/knit-your-own" target="_blank">Zion Lions</a> and <a title="Beastly Boys Beanie" href="https://www.woolandthegang.com/shop/items/beastly-boys-beanie-women/knit-your-own" target="_blank">Beastly Boys Beanies</a>. I've also worked on special projects such as knitting up the <a title="Eek hat" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/shop/items/eek-hat/knit-your-own" target="_blank">Giles Eek </a>hat for London Fashion Week September 2014, and embroidering hats for the Whistles x Wool and the Gang launch.</p>
<p><b>What's the best thing about being a Gangsta? </b>I love working with Wool and the Gang products, it gives me the opportunity to learn new skills.  I've been a knitter for 6 years and I'm still learning new things!</p>
<p><b>What's your favourite WATG knit to date? </b>I really enjoyed knitting the <a title="Beastly Boys" href="https://www.woolandthegang.com/shop/items/beastly-boys-beanie-women/knit-your-own" target="_blank">Beastly Boys Beanies</a>, leopard print knitwear is my favourite.</p>
<p><b>What's on your Xmas knit list? </b>I've been making personalised Christmas stockings for my friends and family, and put my pom-pom maker through its paces to create some <a title="Pom Pom " href="http://blog.woolandthegang.com/2014/12/how-to-make-a-pom-pom-garland/" target="_blank">wooly baubles</a> for my Christmas tree!</p>
<p><b></b><b>If Santa could bring you any WATG knit kit what would it be? </b>It would have to be the <a title="Teen Spirt Sweater" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/shop/items/teen-spirit-sweater-women/knit-your-own" target="_blank">Teen Spirit Sweater</a>. I've yet to try out the tartan effect on my knits and it would certainly keep me warm until the spring arrives!</p>

<p><b>What's the best thing about being a Gangsta? </b>I am addicted to wool and love to knit. The Gang are a great bunch of people too. I remember how excited I was to find Wool and the Gang when my first granddaughter was born. I am always knitting rabbits and other soft toys for the girls.</p>
<p><b>What's your favourite WATG knit to date?</b><b> </b>I am really enjoying knitting the <a title="Stevie Sweater " href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/shop/items/mini-stevie-sweater-mini/knit-your-own" target="_blank">Stevie Sweater</a>s, I have nearly finished a blue one for my unborn grandson and I have two more in the pipeline, in <a title="Lipstick Red " href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/shop/items/crazy-sexy-wool/made-by-the-gang" target="_blank">Lipstick Red</a> and <a title="Crazy Sexy Wool" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/shop/items/crazy-sexy-wool/made-by-the-gang/V033738074" target="_blank">Sandtrooper Beige</a>.

I love the chunky cable, it’s great fun to knit.</p>
