<p>Fashion Revolution Day takes place on 24th April each year. By asking people the simple question 'Who made my clothes?', we are keeping the fashion industry's supply chain in the public eye.</p>
<p>The Fashion Revolution movement rose from the ashes of the Rana Plaza catastrophe in Dhaka, Bangladesh. On 24th April 2013, 1,133 people died and another 2,500 were injured when a factory which produced garments for many of our most familiar fashion brands collapsed.</p>
<p>The notion of knowing where your clothes come from is at the heart of Wool and the Gang, and this year we're inviting our worldwide Gang - that's you! - to join in and spread the message.</p>
<p><strong>Gang Makers, knitters and ready-to-wear customers - we need you, one and all!</strong></p>
<p>We want you all to download our printable PDFs, don your knits or grab your needles and strike a pose.</p>
<p>We have three different designs, as professionally modelled by WATG Gangsta, Lydia:</p>
<p>For Gang Makers - those of you who have knitted Wool and the Gang designs to be sold on site</p>
<p>[stag_image style="no-filter" src="https://watg-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/2015/04/FASHREV1.jpg" alignment="center" url=""]</p>
<p>For knitters - all of you who've made your own Wool and the Gang knits from our kits or yarn</p>
<p>[stag_image style="no-filter" src="https://watg-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/2015/04/FASHREV3.jpg" alignment="center" url=""]</p>
<p>For ready-to-wear customers - those of you who have bought our ready-made knits</p>
<p>[stag_image style="no-filter" src="https://watg-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/2015/04/FASHREV2.jpg" alignment="center" url=""]</p>
<p>Choose your Gang sign, take a snap, and share your results on Instagram and Twitter using the hashtags #whomademyclothes and #shareyourknits in time for Fashion Revolution Day on Friday 24th April.</p>
<p>We'll be sharing all your snaps on our Hang With the Gang page and across our Wool and the Gang social channels.</p>
