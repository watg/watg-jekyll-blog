<p>[stag_intro]Tis' the season for the <a href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/shop/items/buffalo-beanie-women/made-by-the-gang/V060821525" target="_blank"><strong>Buffalo Beanie.</strong></a> The ultimate summer beanie for all you hat lovers and bad hair day hiders. [/stag_intro]</p>
<hr />
<p>Artist, surfer, and designer, Taylr Kreutziger was born and raised from salt and sand.  The ocean is her home and inspiration and the Buffalo Beanie is her new summer companion:</p>
<p>"The buffalo beanie is the best to wear at any time. I honestly have worn it during the middle of summer on the chilly beach nights.  I pair my beanie with an oversized denim jacket, some cut off levis or boyfriend jeans, and a comfortable tee... throw on some ankle booties or sandals and head out!  I can't wait to wear my beanie during the winter season as well... It will be wonderful to have to put on getting out of the cold California surf to keep my head warm!  The material, color, and fit of this beanie allows it to be extremely perfect for every season and location. I can't live without it!"</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.55;">Made from our <strong><a href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/shop/items/mixtape-yarn/made-by-the-gang" target="_blank">Mixtape yarn</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">, </span></strong>which is made from upcycled T-shirt scraps, the hat is light and breezy to wear in warmer climes. The <a href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/shop/items/buffalo-beanie-women/made-by-the-gang/V060821525" target="_blank"><strong>Buffalo Beanie</strong></a> was made for the beach or the city – an ultra versatile hat that will go with anything and everything. (Just sayin'.) </span></p>
