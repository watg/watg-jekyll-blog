<p>A good piece of knitwear should last you a lifetime, not just a season. We love using our 100% natural cotton yarn in the summer, it's perfect for the warmer weather and even when it starts to get chilly. We don't like to coat our yarn in anti-shrink or fixing agents, which means it needs a little extra care when washing your knitwear. You can put your cottons into the wash on a low heat but if you have the time it's best to hand wash. Here is a step by step WATG guide to cleaning your cotton:</p>
<p>1. Make sure you sink is clean and fill with lukewarm water, you won't want the water to hot otherwise it may shrink.</p>
<p>2. We love <a title="Soak!" href="https://www.soakwash.com/" target="_blank">Soak</a>! It's special detergent for cleaning knitwear plus you don't need to worry about rinsing. They also smell amazing! Simply add this to the water.</p>
<p>3. Give your knits a gentle scrub and soak, try not to wring out your cotton as this can cause damage to the yarn and shape.</p>
<p>4. When it's clean, take out your knitwear and lay it flat onto a towel, after this roll it up so press out the water. Repeat until it's almost dry.</p>
<p>5. Lay your cotton flat onto a new fresh towel. Relax!</p>
<p>Even if you do choose to wash your cotton knits in the machine you should make sure that you lye your knitwear flat to dry. This will help keep the shape of the knitwear and make sure it doesn't stretch. We suggest a 30 degree or below wash for all of your clothes.</p>
