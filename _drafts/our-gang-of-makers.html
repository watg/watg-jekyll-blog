<p>We think everyone should be able to enjoy our woolly designs, whether you want to make your own or buy them ready made by our Gang of makers Here's a little more about our ready made business...</p>
<p>So who are this Gang of 'makers'? Well, we refer to them 'makers' as they're people skilled in the art of not just knitting, but crochet and macrame too. Our dream is to one day have a Gang of makers actively producing our designs across the globe, but right now, we work with two main groups of makers.</p>
<h2>Our Peruvian Gang</h2>
<p>Our woollen yarns are produced in Peru, where we work with local Peruvian co-operatives of knitters to produce our larger ready made items. Our Peruvian Gang number around 250 makers, and Aurelie and Jade travel to Peru regularly to see them in action, and to develop new products.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.55;">Our Peruvian Gang knit using the Portuguese method, which involves wrapping the working yarn around their necks or using a pin to create tension. This is a super-speedy way to get your knit on! </span>Hand-knitting and crochet allow our makers to earn an income at home or on the move. They can adapt their working hours to their own routine and around their families.</p>
<p>The finished items are collected by our Peruvian Gang Manager, Andrea, who quality checks them, adds care labels and prepares them to be sent to our warehouse in the UK. We produce only a small number of ready made pieces initially, placing follow-up orders as needed.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;">Our British Gang</h2>
<p>We've had interest from over 3,000 people worldwide in becoming a Gang Maker. As WATG HQ and our distribution services are currently based in the UK, the majority of our makers are based here too. This is because of the time and costs of shipping materials to and from our makers. At any one time, we can be working with around 50-100 individual makers, who will be working on a range of different projects. There are two types of way the British Gang works with us. Most makers do a bit of both - Make to Sell and Make to Order.</p>
<div style="text-align: left;">I have a slightly stressful job, so knitting is what I do to relax. It also helps me to keep my hands busy while I'm watching TV, so I don't keep snacking! If I have a deadline I am working to, I will knit on my commute, at lunch time, and after work. - Tiam, Gang Maker</div>
<h3>1. Make to Sell production</h3>
<p>The majority of our Gang makes items to be sold on the Wool and the Gang website, and this is what we call our Make to Sell business. We call out to our database of knitters when we're preparing to launch new lines and when we need to re-stock our most popular items. Makers are free to choose what they would like to knit, and we allocate jobs based on demand.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.55;">For our Make to Sell business, we ask our makers to purchase the materials needed to make their chosen item - although the finished item is sent to WATG HQ so that it can be sold online, Make to Sell items remain the property of our makers. When a maker's item is sold, we pay them the agreed knitter revenue. Our most popular Make to Sell item is the Zion Lion, which takes between 45 minutes and an hour to knit, and here's an example of how we calculate the revenue paid to each knitter.</span></p>
<p>Zion Lion, RRP £39<br />
Ex VAT price (minus 20% UK sales tax) = £32.50<br />
WATG commission (22%) = £7.15<br />
Knitter revenue = £25.35<br />
Cost of materials (approx 120g of Crazy Sexy Wool) = £9.30<br />
Knitter profit per item = £16.05</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.55;">Our makers order the required materials via our website or have Wool and the Gang materials already in their stash from our sales - from time to time we offer maker discount on yarn and supplies, however our pricing takes into account makers paying full price for materials, Wool and the Gang issue makers with a free shipping code, while makers cover the cost of returning finished items to WATG HQ. </span><span style="line-height: 1.55;">The commission that Wool and the Gang take on each sale goes toward the cost of selling the product and overheads. </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.55;">Not all of our items can be produced using the Make to Sell model - generally speaking, we use this model for a limited number of smaller items (hats, snoods, scarves etc) with knit times ranging between 1-4 hours. Our larger pieces are not made this way as we would have to charge too much to customers in order to make it worthwhile for our makers.</span></p>
<h3>2. Make to Order production</h3>
<p>The other way we produce items is our Make to Order or UK Production model. We use this model for time-sensitive orders, such as requests from press or wholesale customers. We work mainly with makers who live locally to WATG HQ, as they are usually required to collect the materials with which to make, due to the fast turnaround needed. We also use this model to fulfil our custom orders - where items are personalised or made in a new colourway on demand, which is something we're testing on-site at the moment. Our Make to Order makers are paid a fee for completed items - this takes into account the time taken to produce each piece.</p>
<div>I'm totally addicted to knitting.  My day job is very uncreative, so knitting allows me to create beautiful items. I mostly knit in front of the TV, or during my commute, so I'm not really bothered when my bus it stuck in traffic.  Sometimes if I'm heading towards a deadline, my knitting gets me out of doing the washing up too! - Martinette, Gang Maker</div>
<h3>Quality control</h3>
<p>Quality control is a two step process, and applies to all Gang-made items. Firstly, we ask all makers to email photos of their first finished item to the production team. These should indicate all relevant measurements specified in the pattern, and any finishing. We also on-hand on Skype to chat with makers who need additional help. <span style="line-height: 1.55;"> Once all finished knits have been approved, we issue SKU codes to be attached to each item before being sent back to WATG HQ. </span></p>
<p>We do a final check when finished items arrive at Wool and the Gang - provided all is good and well (which it usually is!) the Gang-made items are added to stock and, in the case of our Make to Sell items, made available to buy on-site. <span style="line-height: 1.55;">If we identify any quality issues at this stage, we contact the maker so that these can be fixed.</span><span style="line-height: 1.55;"> </span></p>
<h3><span style="line-height: 1.55;">Unsold items </span></h3>
<p>We keep a close eye on stock levels and try to keep them in line with demand, so we only ask for limited numbers of our Make to Sell items. Because we don't discontinue our designs, all Make to Sell items will stay on the site until they sell, however they remain the property of our makers so at any time, they're free to request that they be returned. We may also choose to discount certain items to help with sell-through. Most of the time Wool and the Gang will cover this cost, so the maker revenue will remain as agreed. Where this is not the case, we'll contact the makers of each item to request their permission to sell items at a lower price, with a lower maker revenue.</p>

<p>Woolly wishes from The Gang</p>
