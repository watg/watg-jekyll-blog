<p>We think everyone should be able to enjoy our woolly designs, whether you want to make your own or buy them ready made by our Gang of makers - we refer to them 'makers' they're skilled in the arts of knitting, crochet and macrame. Here's a little more about our ready made business.</p>
<h2>Our Peruvian Gang</h2>
<p>Our woollen yarns are produced in Peru, and we work with local Peruvian makers to produce our larger ready made items.</p>
<p>Meet xx and xx, two of our Peruvian Gang of makers.</p>
<p>Our Peruvian Gang knit using the Portuguese method, which involves wrapping the working yarn around their necks or using a pin to create tension. This is a super-speedy way to get your knit on!</p>
<p>Hand-knitting allows our makers to earn an income at home or on the move. They can adapt their working hours to their own routine and around their families.</p>
<p>The finished items are collected by our Peruvian Gang Manager, Andrea, who quality checks them, adds care labels and prepares them to be sent to our warehouse in the UK.</p>
<p>We produce only a small number of ready made pieces initially, placing follow-up orders as needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Our British Gang</h2>
<p>We've had interest from over 3,000 people worldwide in becoming a Gang Maker. As WATG HQ and our distribution services are currently based in the UK, the majority of our makers are based here too. This is because of the costs of shipping materials to and from our makers. At any one time, we can be working with around 50 individual makers, who will be working on a range of different projects.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Montserrat; font-size: 1.4375rem; font-weight: bold; text-transform: uppercase; line-height: 1.55;">Make to Sell</span></p>
<p>The majority of our Gang makes items to be sold on the Wool and the Gang website, and this is what we call our Make to Sell business. We call out to our database of knitters when we're preparing to launch new lines and when we need to re-stock our most popular items. Makers are free to choose what they would like to knit, and we allocate jobs based on demand.</p>
<p>For our Make to Sell business, we ask our maker to purchase the materials needed to make their chosen item - although the finished item is sent to WATG HQ so that it can be sold online, Make to Sell items remain the property of our makers. When a maker's item is sold, we pay them the agreed knitter revenue. Our most popular Make to Sell item is the Zion Lion, and here's an example of how we calculate the revenue paid to each knitter.</p>
<p>Zion Lion, RRP £39<br />
Ex VAT price (minus 20% UK sales tax) = £32.50<br />
WATG commission (22%) = £7.15<br />
Knitter revenue = £25.35<br />
Cost of materials (approx 120g of Crazy Sexy Wool) = £9.30<br />
Knitter profit per item = £16.05</p>
<p>Not all of our items can be produced using the Make to Sell model - generally speaking, we use this model for smaller items with knit times ranging between 1-4 hours. Some of our larger pieces just don't work as they wouldn't be profitable for our makers.</p>
<h3>Make to Order</h3>
<p>The other way we produce items is our make to order or UK Production model. We use this model for time-sensitive orders, such as requests from press or wholesale customers. We work mainly with makers who live locally to WATG HQ, as they are usually required to collect the materials with which to make, due to the fast turnaround needed. We also use this model to fulfil our customised orders - where items are personalised or made in a new colourway on demand. Our Make to Order makers are generally paid a fee for completed items.</p>
