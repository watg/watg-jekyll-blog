<p>We asked our HQ Gangsta's for a list of their favorite intermediate knit kits. Now these may be a bit of a challenge for any beginner knitters, but don't forget about our <a title="Wool School" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/video-tutorials">Wool School</a>!  These kits use stitches such the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG3E1-pacI0" target="_blank">Cable Technique</a> and also the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u__Rf-CDC5g#t=100" target="_blank">Twisted Rib Stitch</a>, which looks really effective but are quite simple to master. Our intermediate kit's are all about texture and will definitely keep you warm throughout the winter. Our smaller kit's also make great gifts for your favorite knitter!</p>
<p><a title="Don't speak snood" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/dont-speak-snood-women/knit-your-own" target="_blank">Don't speak snood</a> - This uses the cable technique, which might be a little tricky for any new knitters but it looks really great. You can then use the technique for your mittens and jumpers! This super thick snood uses 3 balls of our Crazy Sexy Wool and the kit also includes the pattern, sewing needles and optional needles.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/dont-speak-snood-women/knit-your-own" target="_blank">Live Forever Cardigan</a> - We love this cardigan, it will keep you warm all winter. The cardigan is made using the Moss Stitch and also the twisted rib stitch, we love the deep pockets on the front! The kit includes 12 balls of our softest Crazy Sexy Wool, a sewing needle, the pattern and the option of our <a href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/rosewood-needles/knitting-supply/V604418633" target="_blank">12mm rosewood knitting needles.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/hole-in-one-sweater-women/knit-your-own" target="_blank">Hole in one sweater </a>- This sweater uses Sugar Baby Alpaca, our finest alpaca yarn, and also our Shiny Happy Cotton. This sweater is lightweight so it's great to wear on summer evening,  and it's also not too hard to knit up. We have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7F1hVyfdqVI#t=23" target="_blank">Wool School Tutorial</a> to help you along with knitting a 'holey stitch'. The kit includes 12 balls of sugar baby alpaca, 5 balls of Shiny Happy Cotton, the pattern and optional 8mm needles!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/fight-the-power-mittens-women/knit-your-own" target="_blank">Fight The Power Mittens </a>- You can knit up these mitten in no time, making them a great gift for any knitter or just a nice evening project. As the knit kit is small you could also take it away with you, why not knit a new pair of mittens for your skiing trip! You only need 1 x ball of Crazy Sexy Wool for our mittens and the kit includes the pattern and needles. As for stitches it's the Rib and Stocking stitch.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/fight-the-power-mittens-women/knit-your-own" target="_blank">Sub Pop Snood</a> - Classic and cool our sub pop kit is great kit for any confidant knitter. Knit up using our Merino and Alpaca blended <a title="Wooly Bully Alpaca" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/wooly-bully-alpaca/yarn-and-wool" target="_blank">Wooly Bully Alpaca</a>. For this you will need to master the twisted rib stitch. The snood kit includes 5 balls of Wooly Bully Alpaca, the pattern and the optional set of 6.5mm needles.</p>
