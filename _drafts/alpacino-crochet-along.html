<p>We'll be getting our knit on for the month of May as we cast on for our second knitalong.  This time we're going to be knitting the Milo Beach Bag. Our knitalong will run throughout May, and all you'll need to get started is a Milo Beach Bag Kit - be sure to order a pair of 12mm needles if you don't already have them in your stash. [stag_image style="no-filter" src="https://watg-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-16-at-11.20.29.png" alignment="center" url="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/milo-beach-bag-women/made-by-the-gang"] To join in, just order your supplies, wait patiently for them to arrive, then knit along! Share your journey on social media - our favourite knit journal will win an Ariel Top Knit Kit in a colour of your choice. Just tag any posts with #knitwiththegang so we see how you're getting on. If you're sharing on a blog, pop the URL in the comments below. WHAT'S A KNITALONG? It's simple - it's a group of people getting together to knit a project, to share their experiences, and to help each other along the way. Sounds great, right? As our Gang are spread across the globe, we'll be coming together online. You can join in on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Ravelry - our hashtag is #knitwiththegang.</p>
