<section>[stag_intro] As knitters we know that an hour can actually be a long time. Although there are lots of things you can do in a hour, for example watch an hour of Homeland, read a chapter of your favorite book, have a long bath or knit up some great jewellery. Check out our top 5 quick knit kits!</section>

<p>Once more our Head Gang Maker Jess has provided us with a list of her favorite kits! This time easy 1 hour long projects. All of these knit projects are small and can fit perfectly into your day bag, so you can take them for your <a title="Commute to work" href="http://blog.woolandthegang.com/2015/01/knitting-tips-on-the-move/">commute to work</a> or to work on over lunch. These projects are also great for using up any left over yarns and even for any last minute birthday gifts. Don't lie, we've all forgotten one at least once.</p>
<div><a href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/moby-scarf/knit-your-own">Moby Scarf</a> - This scarf doesn't even need needles! You can simply use your arms to knit up the oversized and extra cozy scarf. This knit kit uses 3 balls our favorite Crazy Sexy Wool and you can learn how to use your arms for knitting in our <a href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/video-tutorials">Wool School.</a> Simple!</div>
<div></div>
<div><a href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/sansa-duo-choker-women/knit-your-own">Sansa and Khaleesi Jewellery</a> - Knit yourself up some chunky and colourful jewellery to beat off those winter blues. Most of our jewelry uses our recycled <a href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/jersey-be-good/yarn-and-wool">Jersey Be Good</a> . The Jersey Be Good yarn is made from fabric roll off-cuts from fashion factories in Turkey. The unused ends of the rolls are sliced off before sale, then made into this new yarn by the local women. The Jewelry kits comes with Jersey Be Good, clasps and also the pattern and optional needles.</div>
<div></div>
<div><a title="Zion Lion" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/zion-lion-women-1/knit-your-own">Zion Lion</a> - This hat is chic and classic, as well as being super easy to knit up. You could start this hat on your morning commute and have it finished by the time to return home. That's the length of knitting time we love! The Zion Lion uses only 1 ball of our Crazy Sexy Wool, so who knows by the end of the week you could have 5 very happy friends.</div>
<div></div>
<div><a href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/trophy-headbands-women/knit-your-own">Trophy Headband's</a> - We hate having cold ears and we have all agreed that earmuffs are a rather unfashionable solution. So, we introduced our knitted headbands. These are a great alternative to earmuffs and are super quick to knit up. The Trophy head band's use our <a href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/crazy-sexy-wool/yarn-and-wool">Crazy Sexy Wool</a> and can be made in a range of different stitches; Garter Stitch, Stocking Stitch, Holey Stitch and Mistake Rib Stitch.</div>
<div></div>
<div><a href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/strictly-stripes-headband-women/knit-your-own">Strictly Stripes Headband</a> - Knit up this headband using our 1x1 rib stitch, we love this in Space Black and Ivory White but you could try more adventurous colours. Why not knit up a Strictly Stripes headband for your winter break, just remember to check with your airline about carrying needles onto the plane! The kit includes 2 balls of our Crazy Sexy Wool as well as the pattern and 15mm needles.</div>
