<p style="text-align: center;">[stag_intro]Introducing Making Memoirs, the story behind your knits. Starting us off is our Gang Manager, Jess, and her Stevie Sweater...[/stag_intro]</p>
<p>This was my third sweater project and I wanted to make something classic and snug - and something for myself, after having knitted all my family's Christmas presents. I decided on the Stevie Sweater, but switched the yarn from <a title="Wool and the Gang's Sheepaca " href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/sheepaca/yarn-and-wool" target="_blank">Sheepaca</a> to <a title="Wool and the Gang's Sugar Baby Alpaca" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/sugar-baby-alpaca/yarn-and-wool" target="_blank">Sugar Baby Alpaca</a> to make it super-soft. I measured a shop-bought sweater that I love the shape of, and went for the small size of pattern as this was pretty much the same measurements. It took a month of pretty intense knitting - 16 balls of yarn! - and a fair bit of seaming, but I'm so happy with the result - so much so that I'm considering starting a second Stevie...</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Top Tip</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">This was my first time knitting mock fisherman's rib so I mis-knit a few stitches. I'm a bit of a perfectionist and struggled to undo my work without running into disaster, which is where I discovered the lifeline. At the end of a row, thread a scrap piece of yarn through all the stitches on your needle and leave it there. If you make any mistakes and need to rip back you work, just take it off the needles and rip back to the lifeline. Then just reinsert your needle into the stitches on the lifeline and keep knitting!</p>
