<p>Avant-garde jewellery designer <strong>Maria Francesca Pepe</strong> partner with us for a <strong>limited edition collection</strong>.</p>
<p>Entirely realised by Italian artisans, <strong>MFP Jewellery</strong> is a conceptual brand that combines sharp and geometric designs mixed with symbolism and sub-culture references, where classic elements are reinterpreted from their traditional and ethnic forms within a post-modern aesthetic. MFP jewellery is bold looking and suggestive, but the classic simplicity of the designs ensures that they retain versatility. The brand has been initially awarded support by Lulu Kennedy’s Fashion East and BFC’s NEW GEN. Previews accolades include a British Fashion Award nomination and Italian Vogue Talents Award.<br />
MFP is the brand of choice of some of the most followed celebrities worldwide and because of that is recognised as a <em>‘Must have</em>’ and<em> ‘Cool to wear’</em>.</p>
<p>MFP’s treasured mystical jewellery is embellished onto the <strong>Gang’s iconic chunky-knitted beanies</strong> and<strong> headbands</strong>. Precious charms and amulets, hand cut crystal hearts and metal studs contrast with our chunky <strong>Peruvian wool</strong> creating bold and playful accessories.</p>
<p>Each piece is <strong>made unique</strong> by our The Gang’s network of UK knitters and MFP’s Italian artisans team carrying the love of both brands for the art of craftsmanship and attention to detail from start to finish.</p>
<p><em>“When I thought about making some cool, warm, sexy and luxury hats I thought about collaborating with WATG. I like that we are part of the same tribe, and we share the love and the passion of creating beautiful handcrafted pieces with an edge. I met Aurelie and Jade and felt immediate connection. It’s been an effortless and successful collaboration. Can’t wait to wear my MFP+WATG hats next winter!”</em></p>
<p>Maria Francesca Pepe, Jewellery designer.</p>
<p><em>"We like collaborations that are fun and creative and at the same time reflect our Gang’s culture. MFP is pop, cool and contemporary. Both of us enjoy mixing and messing up styles, but above all we really value the process of hand making."</em></p>
<p>Jade Harwood, Co-founder, Creative Director Wool and The Gang.</p>
