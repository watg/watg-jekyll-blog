<p>[stag_intro]This week on <strong>Saturday Stitches</strong> we show you how to knit brioche stitch.[/stag_intro]</p>
<p>This stitch produces a double-sided fabric which is chunky and super squishy, especially when you team it with our luxuriously soft Sugar Baby Alpaca yarn. Here we have worked with two strands of yarn held double in Martini Grey. Simply cast on an even number of stitches and read on for our step by step instructions!</p>
