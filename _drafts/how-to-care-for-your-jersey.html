We all know that jersey knitwear needs a little extra love when it comes to cleaning, so to make loving easier here's the WATG care guide. </section>

<p>We don't like to cover our yarns with synthetic coatings such as anti-shrink or fixing agents. With this in mind please don't put your Jersey Be Good or Mixtape knitwear into the washing machine or tumble dryer.  If you are washing an accessory such as a Zigazag shopper you could just spot-clean, this not only takes less time but also reduces the risk of shrinkage or mis-shaping. Follow these easy steps to keep your jersey clean:</p>
<p>1. Give your skin a clean and fill with lukewarm water, make sure it's not too hot or your jersey may shrink.</p>
<p>2. We love to use <a title="Soak!" href="https://www.soakwash.com/" target="_blank">Soak</a>! It's a specialised knitwear detergent, it's rinse free and it also smells amazing. Add this to the water.</p>
<p>3. Give your jersey a gentle scrub and soak, try not to wring out your clothes as this can cause damage to the yarn.</p>
<p>4. When it's clean, take out your jersey and lay it flat onto a towel, after this roll it up so press out the water. Repeat until it's almost dry.</p>
<p>5. Place your jersey onto a fresh towel, and relax.</p>
<p>Jersey yarns are much easier to look after than their woolly cousin. To keep their shape you should try to store your knits flat, over time hangers can pull at the garment and damage the stitching. We also recommended to keep your <a title="Summer knit kits" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/t/knit-kits/spring-summer-kits" target="_blank">summer knits</a> out of the heat, whilst it may be tempting to let your clothing dry in the sunshine it can often bleach the colour.</p>
