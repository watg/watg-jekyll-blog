<section>[stag_intro] Finishing your first knitting project is a great feeling. After hours knitting and purling it's nice to finally have your finished knitwear, whether it's a simple scarf or a more adventurous sweater or accessory. We don't need to tell you twice how addictive knitting can be, so if you have caught the knitting bug and are looking for an easy second or third winter project look no further. To make life even easier we asked our WATG Gangstas what their Top 5 easy knit kits are. </section>

<p>Knitting is always appealing in the winter. There really is nothing better then settling into your favorite comfortable spot, putting on a TV show and making something amazing. If you're not a seasoned knitter or you're just getting into knitting then trying to choose your next project can be a little daunting, especially if you're not familiar with the names of the stitches or yarns. Here at WATG we think that knitting should be <em>(and it is)</em> really easy, so we have picked out our top 5 easy kits which are perfect for this winter, and winters to come.</p>
<p><a title="Tartan Lula hoop" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/tartan-lula-hoop-women/knit-your-own">Tartan Lula Hoop</a> - The Tartan Lula Hoop is one of our most loved and best selling kits. Although the tartan technique looks tricky it's really simple and adds extra detail to your knits. Once you have mastered the tartan technique you can embroider jumpers, mittens and even hats. The Tartan Lula knit kit includes all the <a title="Wool and the gang " href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/crazy-sexy-wool/yarn-and-wool" target="_blank">Crazy Sexy Wool</a> you will need as well as the pattern and needles.</p>
<p><a title="Zion Lion" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/zion-lion-women-1/knit-your-own" target="_blank">Zion Lion</a> - Knitting up a Zion Lion takes about an hour and a half. The hat is easy to knit up and also looks really great, we know that knitting in a circle may be a challenge for any newbie knitter so if you can try to get your hands on a pair of circular needles. The knit kit includes 1 ball of Crazy Sexy Wool, the pattern and optional 15mm needles. <a title="Zion Lion" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/zion-lion-women-1/knit-your-own" target="_blank">Zion Lion</a>'s are the perfect base hat to embroider on if you're feeling creative.</p>
<p><a title="The Moby Scarf" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/moby-scarf/knit-your-own" target="_blank">Moby Scarf</a> - This scarf is so easy you don't even need needles. We aren't joking. To knit the Moby Scarf you just need your arms. This can be knitted up quickly and is really fun, it's over sized shape and stitches liven up any winter outfit. To knit up the scarf you'll need 3 balls of Crazy Sexy Wool and the Moby Pattern. On our <a href="http://blog.woolandthegang.com/2014/05/arm-knitting/" target="_blank">blog</a> you can learn arm knitting in no time.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/fearless-cardigan-women/knit-your-own" target="_blank">Fearless Cardigan</a> - This may look tricky but it's not. The fearless cardigan is classic and cool, perfect for long winter days. You knit the cardigan as one continuous pieces so there are no fiddly sleeves to attach. Again we have used our favorite Crazy Sexy Wool for this kit, as well as four ball's of this you'll also need our large 25mm needles!</p>
<p><a title="Cross Country " href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/cross-country-coat-women/knit-your-own" target="_blank">Cross Country Coat</a> - This is for our more adventurous new knitters.
