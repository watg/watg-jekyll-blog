<div>At WATG we believe strongly in Me time, which in 'modern' times may be hard to find. Between work, family and general life stealing yourself 2 hours a week might become a bit of challenge. To make the most of your selfish hours why not knit up something wooly as an extra treat. Knitting is proven to be relaxing and meditative...so put your feet up, grab a cuppa and start one of our top 5 quick-knit projects.</div>

<div><a href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/bag-it-up-clutch-women/knit-your-own">Bag It Up Clutch </a>- Using our <a href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/jersey-be-good/yarn-and-wool" target="_blank">Jersey Be Good</a> you can knit yourself up a statement accessory.

<div><a href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/heart-beanie-women/knit-your-own" target="_blank">Heart Beanie</a> - Using our Zion Lion as a base the Heart Beanie is sweet take on a WATG classic. After knitting your beanie base you then embroider a heart and add a <a href="http://blog.woolandthegang.com/2014/05/3-minute-pom-pom/" target="_blank">pom pom</a>! If you're unsure about how to do this you can learn in our Wool School. We use <a href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/crazy-sexy-wool/yarn-and-wool" target="_blank">Crazy Sexy Wool</a> for this beanie, but if you wanted you could embroider in Jersey Be Good for extra texture. For this beanie you will need 3 balls of Crazy Sexy Wool which come in the knit kit along with the pattern, sewing needle and optional needles.</div>
