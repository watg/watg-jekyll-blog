For this jumper we used the classic houndstooth technique, this pattern is popular in both old and new menswear. Knitting the houndstooth pattern is no small task but if you're looking for a jumper to make a statement for seasons to come you've found it. And as always our <a title="Wool School" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/video-tutorials" target="_blank">Wool School</a> is on hand to help with an easy to follow tutorial.<br />

</em><strong>A History of Houndstooth</strong> Why not show off your knowledge as well as your knitting skills. The houndstooth print originates from Scotland, as many classic prints do. It's also known as houndstooth check and dogstooth. First worn by Scottish shepherds the Houndstooth was made popular by upperclass men and women in New York, and became popular again throughout the 60s. Many fashion and knitwear designers use this statement print in their collections, from Chanel to Stella McCartney and...Wool and the Gang. Getting technical, traditionally a houndstooth print is made with alternating bands of dark and light threads which weave together to create the monochrome pattern. put knitwear info in here</div>
