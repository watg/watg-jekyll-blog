<p>If you're new to knitting scarves are a good place to start, mainly because it just involves continuous knitting and there is no tricky sewing up involved. Scarves can be knitted up easily and quickly, so it's an easy confidence boost if you just want to try out a new hobby, but with super soft yarns and hand-made clothing what's not to love. Not to forget that here in the northern hemisphere it's freezing so a few new scarfs are welcomed with albeit shivering arms. You can learn everything from our Wool School. We have easy to follow online tutorials that cover casting on, a range of stitches and common knitting mistakes. Now, here are five cozy beginner knit kits to get stuck into:</p>
<p><a title="Foxy Roxy" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/foxy-roxy-women/knit-your-own" target="_blank"><strong>Foxy Roxy</strong> </a>- You will never be cold again once you have knitted up one of these. Oversized and made from chunky Crazy Sexy Wool this scarf is a statement as well as as a winter staple. Our Knit Kit includes everything you need: 5 balls of Crazy Sexy Wool, a sewing needle and 15mm needles (if you need them). To stitch this up you'll need to learn the <a title="Wool School" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/video-tutorials" target="_blank">Garter Stitch</a>, which you simply do over and over again until you're so relaxed that you don't even realise you have made a huge Roxy Foxy!</p>
<p><strong><a title="Yummy Scarf" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/yummy-scarf-women/knit-your-own" target="_blank">Yummy Scarf</a> </strong>- Very yummy indeed, and you guess it. Super easy. We reckon even a complete beginner could make this is 2-3 hours! The Yummy Knit Kit includes 2 balls of Crazy Sexy Wool, which is a chunky yarn. It's size makes it great for beginners as it's not too fiddly. There is also a sewing needles and an optional set of 15mm needles. Although the Yummy Scarf looks heavy it's actually really lightweight so it's great to wear right through to spring chilly evenings. The Yummy scarf uses a stocking stitch.</p>
<p><a title="Whistler Scarf" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/whistler-scarf-women/knit-your-own" target="_blank"><strong>Whistlers Scarf</strong></a> - This scarf uses the fisherman's rib stitch. Don't be put of by the name, it's much easier than it sounds. This Knit Kit also includes <a title="Crazy Sexy wool" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/crazy-sexy-wool/yarn-and-wool" target="_blank">Crazy Sexy Wool</a>, you'll need 2 balls of the stuff. You also get the sewing needle and the optional 15mm stix. This scarf is classic and will keep you warm for winters to come. Once you have the pattern and needles you can continue to make them for any jealous friends.</p>
<p><a title="Lil Snood Dogg" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/lil-snood-dogg-men-1/knit-your-own" target="_blank"><strong>Lil Snood Dogg</strong></a> - One of our favorites! The Lil' Snood Dogg is chic and cozy whilst being easy to make. The snood uses the <a title="Moss Stitch" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMwpu5kpChg" target="_blank">Moss Stitch</a>, which looks difficult and expensive but is actually super easy. We won't tell if you don't. The kit comes with the usual sewing needle and 15mm needles, although the Snood only needs one ball of Crazy Sexy Wool. Making it a great small Knit Kit for anyone with little time or even as a gift.</p>
<p><a title="Little Giants " href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/little-giant-women/knit-your-own" target="_blank"><strong>Little Giants T-shirt </strong></a>- If you're after a bigger challenge than a scarf then try our Little Giants T-shirt. Made from 6 balls of Crazy Sexy Wool in the Moss Stitch and with the <a title="Wool School" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/video-tutorials" target="_blank">1x1 Ribbing stitch</a> (knit one, purl one) for the edges. The jumper looks great over longsleeves and even without during the warmer months. As it's a T-shirt it takes a little extra time but it's 100% worth it and it's the perfect base for any embroidery you would like to try out.</p>
