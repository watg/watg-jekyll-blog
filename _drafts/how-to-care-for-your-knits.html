<section>After spending weeks knitting your new jumper or scarf, you're now faced with a new challenge: how to care for it. We all know that super soft knitwear needs a little extra love when it comes to cleaning, so to make loving easier here's the WATG care guide. </section>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.55;">A good piece of knitwear should last you a lifetime, not just a season. Soft, sustainable and classic knitted </span><a style="line-height: 1.55;" title="Sweater" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/t/women/sweaters-and-jumpers">sweater</a><span style="line-height: 1.55;">s, mittens or a bag is a must for everyone, whether you made it or bought it. With knitting on the rise and knitwear becoming increasing popular (knitwear for the beach? yes please!) it's important to know how to care for your new investments. We might not be able to help you when you spill red wine over your </span><a style="line-height: 1.55;" title="Ivory white" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/crazy-sexy-wool/yarn-and-wool/V811620644" target="_blank">Ivory White</a><span style="line-height: 1.55;"> sweater, but as we are experts in all things woolly, here is a crash course in knit-care.</span></p>
<p><strong>Wool and Alpaca Blends - <strong><a title="Crazy Sexy Wool " href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/crazy-sexy-wool/yarn-and-wool" target="_blank">Crazy Sexy Wool</a>, <a title="Wooly Bully Alpaca" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/wooly-bully-alpaca/yarn-and-wool" target="_blank">Wooly Bully Alpaca</a>, <a title="Sugar Baby Alpaca" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/sugar-baby-alpaca/yarn-and-wool" target="_blank">Sugar Baby Alpaca</a> &amp; <a title="Sheepaca" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/sheepaca/yarn-and-wool" target="_blank">Sheepaca</a>.</strong></strong></p>
<p>At WATG all of our wool and alpaca <a title="Yarn" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/t/yarn-and-patterns/yarn" target="_blank">yarns</a> are 100% natural. Mother nature makes it just the way we like it, soft and cosy. Whilst this is great for the wool it can make washing a little bit tricky. We suggest a cool hand wash with a <a title="Soak School" href="http://www.soakwash.com/soak-school/knitting/" target="_blank">wool detergent</a>, carefully wash and then lay flat to dry. This will help your knitwear keep its shape.</p>
<p>You may see a few 'bobbles' appear on your knits after a couple of wears. Bobbling or pilling is a natural process and happens due to friction. But don't panic, they are really easy to remove. You can use a wool shaver or comb to remove them. If you don't have either of these you can borrow an old-school hair roller from your nan.</p>
<p>Moths. Need we say anymore. When putting your knitwear away for winter make sure they are clean, moths are attracted to protein fibres such as food, oils and dead skin. To be extra careful keep them in plastic or garment bags, this will help stop them becoming a three course dinner for a winged friend.</p>
<p><strong>Cotton and Jersey Yarns - <a title="Jersey Be Good" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/jersey-be-good/yarn-and-wool" target="_blank">Jersey Be Good</a>, <a title="Mixtape Yarn" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/mixtape-yarn/yarn-and-wool" target="_blank">Mixtape Yarn</a> &amp; <a title="Shiny Happy Cotton" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/shiny-happy-cotton/yarn-and-wool" target="_blank">Shiny Happy Cotton</a>.</strong></p>
<p>We don't like to cover our yarns with synthetic coatings such as anti-shrink or fixing agents. With this in mind please don't put your Jersey Be Good or Mixtape knitwear into the washing machine or tumble dryer. Instead hand wash them gently and place them flat to dry. You can wash Shiny Happy Cotton in the machine, but again we suggest a cool wash. If you are washing an accessory such as a <a title="Hold tight clutch" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/product/hold-tight-duo-clutch-women/knit-your-own" target="_blank">Hold Tight Clutch</a> you could just spot-clean, this not only takes less time but also reduces the risk of shrinkage or mis-shaping.</p>
<p>Cotton and jersey yarns are much easier to look after. To keep their shape you should try to store your knits flat, over time hangers can pull at the garment and damage the stitching. We also recommended to keep your <a title="Summer knit kits" href="http://www.woolandthegang.com/t/knit-kits/spring-summer-kits" target="_blank">summer knits</a> out of the heat, whilst it may be tempting to let your clothing dry in the sunshine it can often bleach the colour.</p>
<p>For all of our knits we love using no-hassle, rinse-free detergents like <a title="Soak" href="https://www.soakwash.com/" target="_blank">Soak</a> (which comes in a range of yummy scents): just leave your knits to soak for 15 minutes, then gently squeeze (no wringing, please!). No need to rinse - which not only saves time and effort, it's also more gentle on your delicate handknits</p>
<p><strong>Look after your knits and they will look after you!</strong></p>
